IT IS RELATED TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE STUDYING ABOUT PLANTS AND ALSO WE GROW WHEAT AND THAT ONE GROWS IN THE DARK THE ONE WITH THE DARKER COLORS
THAT THE YEAST IS ALIVE LIKE FRANKENSTEIN
PLANTS DO NOT NEED WIND BUT THEY DO NEED RAIN FROM THE SAME CLOUD
I THOUGHT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WIND BUT PLANTS NEED CARBON DONOXIDE TO CARBON DONOXIDE YES TO BREATHE
I SEE A HAMBURGER I DON'T THINK PLANTS NEED HAMBURGERS
<DISCARD>
THAT THE YEAST IS BREAKING IT'S DORMANCY I JUST SAID THAT YOU'RE ASKING ME
THEY DO BECAUSE CARBON DONOXIDE IS BASICALLY LIKE OXYGEN FOR US
THEY NEED WATER TO SURVIVE CAUSE HUMANS NEED WATER TO SURVIVE

THEY DO NEED AIR WHAT IT MATTERS ON IF IT'S C O TWO OR O TWO
SPACE ROOM TO GROW AND PROTECTION
THE YEAST STUDY THINGEE MAJIGY
SOME PLANTS DON'T NEED WATER FOR MORE THAN A MONTH BUT ALL PLANTS NEED SOME FORM OF LIQUID
IT IS TRYING TO POINT OUT THAT IT IS ALIVE
HOW DID YOU DUMP IT IN THE TRASH AGAIN
ONE WHEAT PLANT DIDN'T GET ENOUGH STUFF
IT DOESN'T NEED FOOD SO NO
<DISCARD>
IF IT IS SOIL THEN OH WOW YES THEY DO NEED SPACE OR ROOM TO GROW BUT THEY DO NOT NEED IT A FULL

I NOTICED THAT ALL THESE ARE PART OF THE SYSTEM
IT IS ABOUT THE FOOD WEB AND HOW IT WORKS
IT CONNECTS TO BE BEING A CARNIVORE BECAUSE MEAT (()) MEANS MEAT AND (()) MEANS TO EAT
A RED WORM IS A DECOMPOSER
THEY THEY CONSUME THE FOOD FROM THE OTHER ANIMALS OR ORGANISMS TO EAT TO GET FOOD FOR THEIR OWN CELLS
DECOMPOSERS WOULD EAT THE DEAD SOIL AND THE SOIL INSIDE OF A DEAD PLANT MUSHROOMS WOULD ALSO DO THAT BUT THEY WOULD GROW ON TOP OF IT AND START USING IT FOR FUEL WORMS WOULD ATTACK IT SORT OF LIKE A CARNIVORE
A CONSUMER IS SOMETHING THAT CONSUME PRODUCERS WHAT THAT WOULD CONSUME CONSUME PRODUCERS PRODUCERS ARE THE PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS EAT THE PRODUCERS
THEY WOULD EAT DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS
SYSTEMS
BEING A PRODUCER IS PROVIDING FOOD FOR OTHER ANIMALS BEING A PRODUCER IS TAKING THE SUNLIGHT FROM IS TAKING LIGHT ATTACHING IT TO ITSELF AND FEEDING ITSELF AND THEN THE ENERGY GOES TO THE CONSUMERS AND THE CONSUMERS GET THE ENERGY AND THEN THE DECOMPOSERS ONCE THE CONSUMERS DIE EVEN THE DECOMPOSERS GET THE SUNS ENERGY
OMNIVORES EAT MEAT AND PLANTS
SO THEY CAN TAKE AWAY THE UNHEALTHY (()) THINGS AND MAKE THEM HEALTHY AGAIN
THESE CONSUMERS ARE STILL CONSIDERED CONSUMERS BECAUSE THE DEER WOULD EAT THE GRASS THAT IS CONSUMING BUT
THIS IS A DECOMPOSER OR RED WIGGLE WORM IT DECOMPOSES DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO TURN INTO SOIL
DECOMPOSERS CREATE SOIL (()) SOIL FOR THE ENVIRONMENT OR THEIR FECES IS (()) SOIL
AN OMNIVORE IS ALIKE TO HERBIVORES AND CARNIVORES IT GETS ITS FOOD FROM MEAT AND PLANTS JUST LIKE THE CARNIVORES IT EATS MEAT JUST LIKE THE HERBIVORES IT EATS PLANTS IT'S OFF IS IT COME ON WHAT THE
DECOMPOSERS GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE SUN BECAUSE THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM BECAUSE CONSUMERS GET THE ENERGY FROM THE PRODUCERS AND THEY GET THE ENERGY FROM THE DEAD CONSUMERS AND THEY GET
A CARNIVORE IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD EAT MEAT LIKE AN OMNIVORE AN OMNIVORES WOULD EAT BERRIES AND MEAT
ANIMALS GET THEIR ENERGY BY EATING THE ENERGY THAT GETTING THE ENERGY FROM THE PRODUCERS THAT PRODUCE SOME WITH FOOD
A PLANT IS A PRODUCER BECAUSE A CONSUMER OR ANYTHING THAT EATS PLANTS EATS PRODUCERS AND THEN THE PRODUCERS GET THEY ARE CALLED PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE THE FOOD FOR THE FIRST LEVEL CONSUMERS
IT RELATES TO THE ENVIRONMENT CAUSE IT IS (()) SOIL THAT THEY CAN USE FOR PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO GROW AGAIN AND RESTART THE FOOD CHAIN ARE YOU GONNA TALK GEE OH
CONSUMERS PRODUCERS AND DECOMPOSERS
I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THINGS WORK BASICALLY BUT I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IT AND THEY ARE SORT OF EQUAL TO WHAT WE ARE LEARNING
THEY TAKE THE ENERGY AND THEY USE IT FOR ENERGY FOR OTHER PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT CONSUME THEM
WE TALKED FIRST SECOND AND THIRD LEVEL CONSUMERS
THEY EAT MEAT INSIDE OF THEIR ERA
AN HERBIVORE IS A HERBIVORE IT EATS PLANTS
THEY CAN NOT BE THE SAME BECAUSE THE HERBIVORES EAT GRASS AND THE CARNIVORES EAT MEAT SO THEY COULDN'T BE THE SAME CAUSE THEY WOULDN'T EAT THE GRASS AND THE OTHER ANIMALS WOULD NOT EAT THE MEAT THE OMNIVORES WOULD EAT THE BERRIES AND MEAT SO THEY COULD BE LIKE THE HERBIVORES AND CARNIVORES DETRIVORES EAT THINGS LIKE THEY ARE DECOMPOSERS THEY EAT THE DEAD ANIMALS SO THEY ARE ALIKE TO EVERYTHING
A (()) IS ALL ABOUT DECOMPOSERS
THESE RED WORMS ARE (()) INTO ROTTING LEAVES AND OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A LITTLE BIT OF SOIL THEY'VE TURNED IT INTO (()) SOIL AS THEY CONSUMED IT AND USED IN THEIR WASTE PRODUCTS
THEY'RE IMPORTANT IN A FOOD WEB BECAUSE IT NEEDS SOMETHING TO DECOMPOSE THE DEAD ANIMALS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT
THE WASTE MATERIALS TURNED INTO (()) SOIL THAT THEY HAVE EATEN OVER THE PAST WEEKS
A DECOMPOSERS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD EAT THE DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS TECHNICALLY IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN OMNIVORE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IT'LL ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE ANIMALS I WOULD CONSIDER IT A CARNIVORE
THIS IS A FOOD WEB THE DEER WOULD HARM THE RABBIT AND THE RABBIT WOULD EAT THE GRASS THE LION WOULD HARM THE POLAR BEAR AND THEN THE MEAT WOULD GO TO THE POLAR BEAR AND THEN THE POLAR BEAR WOULD GO TO THE LION THE BEAR EATS WOULD GO TO THE MEAT AND THEN THE MEAT WOULD GO TO THE BEAR AND THEN THE BEAR WOULD GO TO THE HUNTER AND SOIL WOULD GO TO A MUSHROOM AND THEN THE AND THEN THE MUSHROOM WOULD GO TO THE WORM
YES
WELL THERE'S TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE ENERGY THE BATTERY HAS GIVES IT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND IT MAKES IT LIGHT UP
WELL SINCE IT'S IF YOU FLIP THE BATTERY AROUND LIKE YOU TOLD ME TO DO IT WILL GO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THAT IT DOES WHEN IT'S THE FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
I DON'T REALLY KNOW I DON'T THINK MY TEACHER HAS TOLD US BUT UM YEAH <LAUGH>
BECAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE SWITCHING THE WAY THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS JUST LIKE YOU SWITCHED THE BATTERY AND THE MOTOR
WELL I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS IF IT'S FROM THE POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE AS FAR AS THE ENERGY GOES
WELL TODAY WE DID SCIENCE AND WE USED A BOARD AND WE PLACED A LIGHT BULB IN A LIGHT BULB HOLDER AND A BATTERY HOLDER IN A BA- AND THE BATTERY IN A BATTERY HOLDER AND WE MADE A CIRCUIT SO THE AND WE ALSO HAD A MOTOR S AND WE HAD TO MAKE THE MOTOR AND THE LIGHT THE LIGHT HAD TO GO ON AND THE MOTOR HAD TO LITTLE PIECE OF TAPE THAT HAD TO SPIN
YES
YEAH IT'S SPINNING THE THE THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THAT IT WAS WHEN THE BATTERY WAS THE OPPOSITE WAY
I THINK THAT IT IS GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE
I DON'T THINK IT DOES
OKAY
YES
WELL <BREATH> AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE MOTOR AND MAKES THE FLAP SPI-
INSTEAD OF GOING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IT'LL GO FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
OKAY
UM I THINK IT DOES
SORT OF
BECAUSE IT'S STILL FLOWING THE SAME SPEED BUT IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
NO I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WELL THE BATTERY HAS TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO IT AND THEN IT'S CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR WHICH MAKES THE LITTLE TAPE FLAP SPIN
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S STILL WORKING BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK AS FAST TO ME
YEAH THAT'D BE COOL
YOU'RE WELCOME
I CAN SEE THAT IT'S GOING FROM THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT S AND IT GOES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB LIKE IF IT WAS STILL SORT OF UM YEAH
UM <FP> LIKE I SAID IT JUST SWITCHES THE WAY THE THE MOTOR'S FLAP RUNS
WELL MAYBE BECAUSE IT SWITCHES THE BATTERY IT SWITCHES THE MOTOR'S WAY OF RUNNING <BREATH> IT'S LIKE THE SAME THING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE TO POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE
UM WHAT DO YOU EXACTLY MEAN
UM I THINK IT WON'T WORK AS A G I D I JUST DON'T THINK IT WILL WORK I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER DOING IT
YES
WELL WE UM WE SORT OF HAD WIRES AND WE PUT THE WIRES ON THE BATTERY ENDS FROM THE POSITIVE TO THE NEGATIVE NO NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE AND SO THEN WE HOOKED THAT UP TO THE MOTOR AND THEN WE HOOKED ONE OF THE MOTOR'S WIRES TO THE SWITCH THAT WE HAD
UM I DON'T THINK MUCH HAPPENS BECAUSE IT JUST SORT OF SINCE YOU SWITCHED THE BATTERY IT'S SORT OF LIKE SWITCHING THE MOTORS WAY OF THE TAPE SPINNING
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHY DO YOU WANNA DO IT LIKE WH-
WELL WE JUST HAD TO USE THEM AS LIKE A WEIGHT TO LIFT THE MAGNETS APART
GOOD
OKAY
WELL WE HAVE SOME WHAT ARE THEY CALLED WASHERS WE HAVE TWO CUPS AND WE HAVE TWO MAGNETS AND WE USE THEM TO SEE HOW THE FORCE IS UM HOW IT WORKS
UM WELL WE HAVE TO PUT IT TOGETHER AND WE DID IT WITH A CHIP IN THE MIDDLE AND IT WE HAD TO SEE HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK SO THAT IT WOULD TAKE THE MAGNETS APART
IT'S OKAY
WELL USING THE WASHERS WE HAD TO <BREATH> MAKE THE WEIGHT UM STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE THE MAGNETS UM NOT WANT TO BE T
WELL HERE YOU CAN TRACE TWO PATHWAYS UM WITH ONE LIGHT BULB AND ANOTHER LIGHT BULB YOU CAN TRACE ANOTHER ONE
I THINK IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
BYE
WELL I CAN SEE TWO CIRCUITS BUT THEY'RE SEPARATE AND ONE HAD I THINK IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND ONE IS SERIES
WHAT
WELL THERE'S THE TWO LIGHT BULBS AND A ONE BATTERY SO I AM GUESSING CAUSE WE DID THIS IN CLASS IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO LIGHT VERY BRIGHTLY IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE PRETTY DIM
CAN'T UNDERSTAND
THIS IS ALSO A PARALLEL BECAUSE YOU CAN TRACE TWO PATHWAYS AGAIN
BATTERY
WELL IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT THAT IT'S WHERE YOU CAN TRACE TWO PATHWAYS
UM DO YOU MEAN WITH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
YEAH
WELL LIKE I SAID WE DID THIS ONE IN CLASS AND MANY TIMES AND IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK VERY WELL SO I WOULD ADD ANOTHER BATTERY AND THAT WOULD MAKE IT UM TO I MEAN IT IT WOULD MAKE THEM BRIGHTER
OKAY
UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
YEAH
UM WELL I THINK THIS WOULD WORK BECAUSE IT HAS TWO BATTERIES TOUCHING BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S NOT I THINK THE <BREATH> MINUS SIDE SHOULD BE WHERE THE PLUS SIDE IS
WELL ONE IS FROM THE BATTERY TO THE FIRST LIGHT BULB AND THEN ONE YOU COULD TRACE I'M NOT SURE IF IT IS BUT UM FROM ONE LIGHT BULB TO ANOTHER THAT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER ONE TO ME
UM I THINK IT LOOKED A LITTLE LIKE THIS
WELL A CIRCUIT UM THE WORD CIRCUIT COMES FROM CIRCLE SO YOU COU WOULD BE USUALLY BE ABLE TO TRACE WITH YOUR FINGER A CIRCLE OR NOT <LAUGH>
WELL THE TWO CIRCUITS IS THAT YOU CAN LIKE TRACE TWO PATHWAYS LIKE YOU CAN IN THIS ONE BECAUSE CAN TRACE ONE FROM THE BATTERY TO ONE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY TO AN ANOTHER LIGHT BULB
YEAH IT CAN'T GO THROUGH PAPER
WHAT I SEE IS TWO CIRCUITS AND ONE THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS A BATTERY THEN TWO LIGHT BULBS AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS A BATTERY AND THEN IT HAS A LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT HAS AN ANOTHER LIGHT BULB BUT IT'S SORT OF MORE LIKE A UM IT I THINK THAT ONE'S PARALLEL AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A SERIES CIRCUIT
UM WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY IF WE MADE IT PARALLEL WOULD THAT MAKE IT SHINE BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
NO
WAIT WHAT'S IT CALLED PARA
WELL THIS IS A WHAT'S IT CALLED A
WELL WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PARALLEL CIR- CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
OKAY
UM THERE'S A LITTLE THING THAT SAYS ENABLE HARDWARE ACCELERATION
OKAY
JUST BECAUSE WE DID THIS EXPERIMENT WHERE THEY THEY TOLD US IN THE SCIENCE BOOK THAT UM PEOPLE WERE BUYING THESE BIG ROWS OF LIGHTS AND THEY WERE USING THEM AND WHEN ONE BURNT OUT THE R THE REST BURNT OUT AND SO WE HAD TO TRY TO COMBINE TWO GROUPS' IDEAS AND OUR GROUP'S WORKED
THAT WHEN YOU SWITCH THE BATTERIES THEY YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IT WAS DIMMER BEFORE BUT THEN IT LIGHTS UP BRIGHTLY
YOU'RE WELCOME
BECAUSE YOU CAN TRACE A PATHWAY FROM ONE MOTOR TO THE OTHER
TWO
WELL I SEE A BATTERY AND A MOTOR AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE M IS I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIGHT BULB OR SOMETHING BUT I IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME A PARALLEL CIRCUIT <BREATH>
WELL I THINK THEY S THEY LIT UP BRIGHT MORE BRIGHTLY
<BREATH> WITH ALL THE CIRCUITS AND EVERYTHING
THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
CHOCOLATE CHIP MINT
IT'S OK
WELL SINCE P UM ELECTRICITY CANNOT GO THROUGH PAPER IT WOULD STOP THE LIGHT BULB'S BRIGHTNESS TO COME OUT
OKAY
OKAY
WHAT
THANK YOU
UM I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT PROBABLY WOULD BUT THE GOOD THING ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS THAT WHEN ONE BURNS OUT THE REST DON'T
WHEN I SWITCHED THE BATTERIES I NOTICED THAT THEY BECAME MORE BRIGHTLY
WELL IT'S IF YOU HAVE A CIR- A SERIES CIRCUIT YOU CAN ONLY TRACE ONE WITH YOUR FINGER WHICH IS USUALLY A CIR- A CIRCLE WHICH IS WHY CIRCUIT COMES FROM CIRCLE
NO
YOU COULD DO IT LIKE WITH A LIGHT BULB AND THEN YOU COULD GET A WIRE TO IT AND THEN THE WIRE TO THE LIGHT BULB WHICH GETS AN ONE WIRE TO THE BATTERY
IT'S SERIES
UM WELL YEAH WHEN WE WERE DOING THE EXPERIMENT OF WHEN THE PEOPLE BO BOUGHT THE STRING OF LIGHTS WE HAD DONE IT AND THEN WE PUT LIKE A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER UNDER IT TO SEE IF IT WOULD BLOCK THE ELECTRICITY FLOW AND IT DID AND AS SOON AS THAT HAPPENED THE OTHER ONE UM BURNED OUT AS WELL
WELL THE BATTERY HAS A WIRE TO THEY LITTLE THING THAT CONNECTS TO THE LIGHT BULB WHICH MAKES THAT LIGHT UP BUT THEN YOU NEED THE WIRE TO THE OTH- THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY WHICH HAS ANOTHER WIRE THAT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THAT HAS ANOTHER WIRE THAT GOES TO THE BULB BATTERY
AND IT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WILL STILL KEEP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S PARALLEL
I THINK THE OTHER ONE WOULD BURN OUT AS WELL CAUSE IT'S NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
WELL THE BATTERY GIVES ENERGY TO THE THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB WHICH MAKES IT LIGHT UP <BREATH>
THANK YOU
NOT REALLY
IN A CIRCUIT
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAUSE IF YOU TOOK OUT SAY THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THEN THE THE RIGHT ONE WOULD GO OUT AND WOULDN'T TURN BACK ON UNTIL YOU PUT ON THE LEFT ONE
I KNOW THAT UM CIRCUITS IS WHAT I KEEPS THE UM LIGHT BULBS IN OUR HOUSE RUNNING AND IT'S NOT THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN WE TURN OFF THE LIGHT IN ALL THE OTHER LIGHTS DON'T TURN OFF
I SEE THAT ONE LIGHT BULB PAIR OF LIGHT BULBS IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER ONE AND THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS I BELIEVE
YES
THIS ONE IS UM <BREATH> IT'S IT'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY BECAUSE THERE IS FOUR WIRES BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY TO FLOW FROM HERE TO THE OTHER ONE
UM WHEN ONE BULB GOES OUT ON THIS ONE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO H FLOW THROUGH
OK BYE
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND ONE OTHER CIRCUIT WHICH I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF
MABE I'M NOT REALLY SURE
THERE'S MORE THAT ONE TYPE OF CIRCUIT I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWO CIRCUITS CAUSE ONE TYPE IS WHEN YOU TAKE OFF ONE LIGHT BULB THEN THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT AND THE OTHER IS WHEN YOU CAN TAKE OUT A LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE STILL GOES ON
THIS ONE HAS ONE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWO
NOT YET
I THINK PARALLEL IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TAKE ONE OFF THEN THE OTHER ONE TURNS OFF
UM NOT THAT I REMEMBER
UM I THINK IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE IF THERE WAS ONLY THE LITTLE NOTCH AT THE TOP THAT THE LIGHT BULB WOULDN'T EVEN WORK
I THINK THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AN AS MANY BENDS AND TWISTS UM IN THE WIRE MAYBE CAUSE THAT WOULD BE HARDER FOR THE ENERGY TO GET THROUGH THAN JUST A STRAIGHT OR SLIGHTLY CURVED WIRE
UM THIS ONE I THINK IS THE ONE WHERE IF YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONES ARE GOING TO TURN OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NOT TWO OTHER WIRES TOUCHING THE BATTERY THERE'S TWO OTHERS TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS AND ON TWO TOUCHING THE UM BATTERY
WELL UM THE WIRE'S KIND OF LIKE A PATHWAY OR A HIGHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH AND IF THE WIRE WASN'T THERE THE ENERGY WOULDN'T GO THROUGH
UM YES AND NO THE WIRES LOOK THE SAME UM THE BATTERY LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND THE LIGHT BULBS LOOK DIFFERENT
I THINK THAT THIS ONE IS THE SAME UM AS THE OTHER ONE BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE BUT WHAT I MEAN BY MORE THAN ONE WIRE IS THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WIRE TOUCHING THE BATTERY
THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS GOING NO WAIT YEAH SO I THINK THIS IS THE OTHER ONE WHERE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS AND THEN IF YOU TOOK OUT THE LEFT LIGHT BULB THE RIGHT ONE WOULD STILL BE GOING ON
WELL ON THE OTHER ONE THE UM THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS FOR THE BATTERIES I MEAN FOR THE LIGHT THE ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH BUT WITH THIS ONE IT'S THE ONLY ONE PATHWAY SO IF THERE'S NOT A SOURCE TO GET THROUGH TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE THEN IT CAN'T GO THROUGH
UM I THINK IT TELLS ME THAT THE MIDDLE THING'S THE LIGHT THE UM BATTERY IN THE MIDDLE THE THINGS THAT ARE SURROUNDING IT ARE THE WIRES AND THE TWO LITTLE ROUND THINGS WITH THE LITTLE LINES IN IT ARE THE LIGHT BULB
THE CIRCUIT I THINK IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THE OTHER ONE ONLY THE LIGHT BULBS ARE UM BY TO OTHER AND THE WIRES ARE THE SAME BUT THEY'RE SHAPED DIFFERENT
GOOD
I THINK IT COULD BE BOTH ACTUALLY
IN OUR HOUSE IT'S NOT PARALLEL BECAUSE PARALLEL'S THE ONE THAT WHEN YOU TAKE OFF WHEN YOU TURN OFF A LIGHT BULB ALL THE OTHER ONE'S TURN OFF AND THE OTHER ONE'S THE ONE WHERE YOU TURN ONE OFF THE OTHER ONE'S STILL ST
WELL A PARALLEL CIRCUITS IS A CERTAIN TYPE OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU CAN USE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND STUFF
AT THE UM WELL YOU CAN'T PUT IT ON THE GLASS BUT FURTHER DOWN FROM THE GLASS THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE SWIRLY THING WHERE IT WOULD GO IN ONE OF THE SOCKETS YOU'D PUT ONE OF THE WIRES ON THERE AND THEN THE LITTLE ROUND THING ON THE BOTTOM
MAYBE IT'S COMING FROM THE LIGHT BULB SINCE IT'S TOUCHING THE BATTERY IT MUST BE COMING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE BATTERY SOMEHOW BY THE LIGHT BULB
THE WIRES ARE SORT OF KIND OF LIKE IF YOU WERE DRIVING A CAR WOULD SORT OF BE LIKE A HIGHWAY TO GET UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK DOWN AGAIN
BYE
WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW IN A CERTAIN PLACE TO GO BACK UP TO THE BULB AND GO THROUGH THE KINDA THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SPRING WHERE IT MAKES IT HARD FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO GO AND THEN IT UM LIGHTS UP
THE WIRE HAS TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE
YES
A CIRCUIT
<FP> UM WELL YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS ON THE THE TWO PARTS PERFECTLY OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T TURN ON IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT SHOULD TURN ON AND STAY ON FOR A LITTLE BIT
I SEE IT'S UM WELL I SAW IT CAUSE IT WAS IT WON'T WORK IF I DON'T PUT IT ON THE UM BUTTON BUT UM IT IT WE IT'S GOING THROUGH A CERTAIN PARTS UP TO A LITTLE WIRE COMING UP INTO THE GLASS PART MAKING IT GLOW COMING BACK DOWN AND GOING AROUND AND THEN UP AGAIN
WE WERE USING WIRE AND A LIGHT BULB AND A BATTERY TO SEE IF WE COULD LIGHT UP THE UM LIGHT BULB
WELL THERE'S THE LITTLE THING WHERE YOU PUT IT
UM NO <LAUGH>
IT CONNECTS TO TWO WIRES CIRCUITS UM DANGIT I JUST FOR
YEP
WELL HERE NO BECAUSE THE WIRE ISN'T TOUCHING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY BUT THE LIGHT BULB IS BUT IT SEEMS TO BE ON WHICH IS CONFUSING ME
GOING IT'S GOING FROM THE MINUS SIDE UM THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK DOWN TO THE PLUS SIDE AND DES
WELL I DON'T THINK IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IT'S ONLY TOUCHING ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
YES
E PLACE WHERE
WELL IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY GOING FROM THE MINUS SIDE FIRST BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT MY TEACHER SAID
UM A HIGHWAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO COME THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB
WELL WHAT YOU DO WOULD YOU WRAP IT A KIND OF MAKE A CIRCLE AROUND THE UM BATTERY AND THEN YOU'D PUT IT ON THE PLUS SIDE AND TOUCH WITH BOTH THE WIRES YOU TOUCH ONE ONE METAL PART AND THEN ANOTHER METAL PART AND IT SHOULD TURN ON
YES IT'S A CIRCUIT
IT GOES FROM THE PLUS SIDE THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TIL IT STARTS GLOWING AND THEN WHEN IT'S GLOWING MORE *ELECTRICITY* FLOWS THEN IT GOES TO THE MINUS SIDE BUILDS UP UNTIL ALL THE ELECTRICITY IS GONE FROM THE PLUS SIDE AND EITHER THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT OR JUST THE BATTERY WILL BURN OUT
UM ACTUALLY NO I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT AREA WHERE THE NOTCHES ARE
IT FLIPS IT AROUND
WE WE W I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE BLUE THING AND I DIDN'T WORK WITH THE RED THING ON THE LIGHT BULB WE ONLY WORKED WITH THE WIRE THE D CELL BATTERY AND JUST A LIGHT BULB NOT WITH THE RED STUFF ON IT
THE THE ELECTRICITY IS ACTUALLY FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH ONE OF THE NOTCHES OR SOMETHING BACK INTO THE BATTERY
THEY ARE I BELIEVE THEY ARE LIKE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HELP IT COME THOUGH AND IF IT WASN'T THERE IT WOULD BE V FAIRLY HARD TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY COME THROUGH
INTO THE LIGHT BULB
YOU'D HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE SWIRLY THING KIND OF RIGHT UNDER THE UM LIGHT THE GLASS PART AND THEN RIGHT UNDER THAT IS THE LITTLE LIP KINDA THING AND YOU HAVE TO TOUCH ONE OF THE WIRES THERE TOO
IT TRAVELS FROM THE PLUS SIDE BACK THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB TO THE MINUS SIDE AND GETS STORED INTO THE MINUS *SIDE* IT MINUS SIDE UNTIL THE BATTERY IS BURNED OUT
THE BATTERY
GOOD
WELL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCLE OF THE WIRE COMING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY <BREATH> TO THE OTHER AND
YES
IF YOU STACK UP THE PENNIES YOU CAN MAYBE HOLD MORE PASSENGERS
I DON'T KNOW
THAT'S HOW MANY PASSENGERS IT COULD HOLD
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VARIABLES
YOU'RE WELCOME <BREATH>
UH WELL THIS PICTURE TELLS ME UH THE MORE THE PENNIES ARE LIKE SPREAD OUT IN THE BOAT THE HEAVIER IT GETS AND IF THEY'RE STACKED UP THEY'RE WIDER
UH UH WE PUT PENNIES IN LITTLE CUPS SO THAT THE PENNIES ARE RELATED TO THE PASSENGERS SO WE SEE HOW MANY THE CUPS CAN HOLD
BOATS
IF THE BOAT'S WIDE MORE PASSENGERS CAN FIT IN THE CORNERS OR ON THE SIDES AND UH <BREATH> FOR THE WAIT
HOW BIG OR WIDE THE BOAT IS
I NOTICED THAT THE TALLER THE TALLER THE PENNIES ARE STACKED UP THE MORE IT CAN HOLD
WELL THE D BOAT WILL HAVE THE LEAST PASSENGERS BECAUSE IT'S SMALLER AND THEN C IT'LL HAVE THE BIGGEST BECAUSE IT'S THE BIGGEST ONE
I FIGURED OUT THAT UH THE BIGGER THE LIFEBOATS THE MORE PENNIES IT COULD HOLD
UH IF YOU LIKE DROP THE PENNIES FROM A HIGH PLACE OR SOMETHING UH THAT'LL THAT'LL MAKE THE BOAT SORT OF HEAVY AND THEN IT WILL KNOCK IT DOWN TO THE WATER SO IT'LL SINK
YOU ALREADY AXED ASKED ME THAT
WELL YOU COULD STACK UP LIKE YOU COULD HAVE THREE PILES STACKED UP ONE ON THE LEFT ONE IN THE MIDDLE AND ONE ON THE RIGHT TO MAKE H MORE PASSENGERS AND BALANCED
IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT UH HOW MANY PENNIES LIKE ARE FITTING IN EACH BOAT <BREATH>
A IS THE BIGGEST IT WOULD A HOLD MORE PASSENGERS
PAPER CUPS
I DON'T KNOW
IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
A PENDULUM
MAKE THE STRING SHORTER BECAUSE IT WILL SWING FASTER
HOW FAST THE PENNIES GO BACK AND FORTH
UH THE STRING DOES MOST OF THE WORK
I DON'T KNOW
NO
IF YOU MAKE IT LONGER IT COULD GO FA- UH THIS MORE TIMES TOO
THE STRING THE PAPERCLIP THE PENNY AND THE PENCIL
THEY WILL SWING BACK AND FORTH
IT GOES BACK AND FORTH
THE SHORTER IT IS THE UH FASTER IT'LL SWING SIDE WAYS O
TWO
I FOUND OUT THAT IT SWINGS
BYE
I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT EITHER
THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS
GOOD
THERE'S A PENNY CONNECTED TO A PENCIL AND A PAPERCLIP AND A STRING
WELL I THINK THIS PICTURE SHOWS THE CAPACITY UH OF THE BOAT WHICH IS MA
WE'VE BEEN MAKE
I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHEN WE CHANGED THE CAPACITY UH IT WAS ABLE TO HOLD MORE PENNIES
THE X AXIS IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND THE Y AXIS IS ON SORT OF THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN
IT EITHER GOT SMAL- THE PASSENGERS NUMBER EITHER GOT SMALLER OR BIGGER
I NOTICE THAT THE X CAPACITY IS THE MILLIMETERS AND THE Y CAPA- PA CAPACITY THING IS THE PASSENGERS
UH WELL THEY SHOW THE NUMBER OF SOMETHING LIKE GREATEST TO OR OR LEAST TO GREATEST
I THINK IT'S ABOUT UH THE Y AXIS IS THE PASSENGERS SO LIKE UH THE NUMBER BELOW WHAT THE MILLIMETERS CAN HOLD THAT BIG OF A NUMBER FROM LIKE NINETY TO SIXTY OR SOMETHING
THE Y AXIS IS ON THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND
THE Y AXIS SHOWS HOW MANY PASSENGERS THERE ARE
HELLO
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE Y AXIS IS HOW MANY OF P PASSENGERS AND THE X AXIS IS THE VOL- IS THE CAPACITY HOW LARGE IT IS
WELL MAYBE HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD OR MAYBE HOW LONG IT CAN STAY IN THE WATER
YES
I CAN FIGURE OUT LIKE THE BIGGEST THE BIGGER THEY ARE UH THE PASSENGERS IT'S HALF OF THE NUMBER THAT THE MILLIMETERS ARE
GOOD
WELL ON EVERY BOAT THE SMALLER THEY GOT THE SMALLER PENNIES HAD TO GO IN TO THE BOAT
I SEE THAT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN THERE ARE NUMBERS COUNTING BY TENS SO THOSE ARE THE MILLIMETERS AND UH THE PASSENGERS ONE HUNDRED MILLIMETERS CAN HOLD SIXTY AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING IN A ROW
LIFE BOATS
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THANK YOU
I SEE THAT THE NUMBERS RISING UP
YES
UH MAYBE THE GROWING OF THE PASSENGERS AND THE GROWING OF THE CAPACITY
THE X AXIS IS THE WHERE THE CAPACITY MILLIMETERS ARE
I DON'T REMEMBER
I NOTICED THAT THE NUMBER OF THE CAPACI- THE PASSENGERS GOT LARGER AS THE CAPACITY GREW
I CAN
THANK YOU
IF I CHANGE A BUNCH OF STUFF LIKE
WHAT SIZE THE BOAT IS
NOTHING
THANK YOU
WELL IF I TAKE LESS PENNIES OUT UH THAT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE IT GETS LIGHTER SO IT RISES UP MORE OUT OF THE WATER
THE MORE
SOMEONE'S DROPPING MORE PENNIES INTO THE BOAT
I DON'T KNOW
BECAUSE IF ALL THE SIDES ARE BALANCED THEY WON'T TIP OVER TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT
I DON'T KNOW
MORE
UH SO THE BIGGER THE BOAT THE MORE PENNIES IT COULD HOLD
UH WE DID UH STUFF ABOUT BOATS AND HOW MANY PENNIES THEY COULD HOLD WITHOUT SINKING
I CAN'T REMEMBER
UH <BREATH> PENNIES ARE LIKE PASSENGERS SO LIKE THE BIGGER THE BOAT THE MORE IT CAN HOLD
THANK YOU
MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS BALANCED ON THE BOAT
I
I IT WOULD LIKE SINK
I DON'T KNOW
THANK YOU
UH LIGHTS
ACTUALLY I MEAN THE THAT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE IT CAN HOLD
UH I F DON'T REMEM- I DON'T REMEMBER
IT'S TELLING ME A GRAPH ABOUT UH BOATS
NO
I DON'T KNOW
HI
I DON'T REMEMBER
AND THEIR SIZE
I CAN'T REMEMBER <BREATH>
I DON'T KNOW
UH IF I CHANGE A BUNCH OF THINGS IT
WELL UH IF THERE'S MORE PENNIES ON ONE SIDE A AND NONE ON THE OTHER SIDE IT COULD TIP OVER AND SINK
THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK OF
GOOD BYE
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S UH PUT IN TO THE BASE SO UH SO YOU P SO AFTER YOU PUT THE CORK ON IT YOU PULL BACK THE STICK AND THEN LET IT GO
UH I THINK IT'S ABOUT SEEING HOW FAR UH THE CORK GOES AFTER YOU LAUNCH IT
UM I PULLED DOWN THE STICK AND I TOOK MY FINGER OFF AND IT LAUNCHED THE CORK
UH A BASE A STICK A A STICK THAT COULD HOLD AN ICE POP OR SOMETHING AND AN ICE TRAY
UH I DON'T REALLY KNOW YET
SO YOU KNOW HOW LONG SO IF YOU PULL OUT FIVE CENTIMETERS AND YOU LAUNCH IT AND SAY IT GOES FORTY NINE CENTIMETERS UH THAT'S HOW FAR IT WENT ACTUALLY I REALLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT QUESTION
UH THE WEIGHT OF THE CORK MAKES 'EM DIFFERENT
I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW FAR THE CORK WAS LAUNCHED
I NOTICED THAT THE SHORTER THE STICK'S IN THE FARTHER IT WILL GO
WELL I CHANGED THE ANGLE FOR VARIABLE BECAUSE I THOUGHT
WELL IF YOU CHANGE THE ANGLE IF YOU MAKE IT SORT OF SLANTED DOWN IT MIGHT GET MORE HANG TIME IN THE AIR AND GO FARTHER
YOU WON'T KNOW UH YOU WON'T KNOW YOUR DATA BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE WINDS YOU DON'T KNOW LIKE HOW FAR YOUR STICK WAS OUT OF THE BASE
HOW FAR YOU CAN LAUNCH THE CORK
YOU PUT 'EM IN BETWEEN THE TWO S S TWO STICKS THAT ARE ON TOP OF THE POPSICLE STICKS
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT QUESTION
I DON'T KNOW
I THINK THE BOTTOM ONE WENT F FURTHER BECAUSE THE CORK WAS LIGHTER
WELL SINCE THE TOP ONE WEIGHED MORE UH IT DIDN'T GET MUCH MORE HANG TIME BECAUSE IT'S SO HEAVY THAT WHEN IT GETS IN THE AIR IT DROPS DOWN FASTER
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON CATAPULTS
WELL I PULLED THE I ICE CUBES ICE CUBES STICK UH THE ICE POPSTICK OUT MORE AND IT MADE IT GO FARTHER TO AND IT MADE IT GO FARTHER BECAUSE IT WAS LONGER
I NOTICED THAT UM THEY'RE USING A RULER TO MEASURE IF YOU PULL IT OUT FIVE CENTIMETERS HOW LONG IT WILL GO WITH FOUR CENTIMETERS IT WILL GO
THANK YOU
SO YOU NEED AN ANGLE BRACE A FLIP STICK A CORK
THEY MAKE THE CORK LIKE FLY
IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE UH THEN LIKE YOU COULD WRITE YOUR DATA ON A PIECE OF PAPER SO YOU WOULD KNOW UM HOW FAR IT WENT
YOU PUT IT IN BETWEEN THE TWO UM LITTLE SQUARE SHAPED STICKS THAT ARE ON TOP OF THE FIRST STICK
NO THAT'S IT
S STUDYING UH THE WELL SOMETHING I FORGET
THE PENDULUM IS SWINGING BACK AND FORTH
UH SWINGING SIDE WAYS
THERE'S A PENNY CONNECTED TO A PAPERCLIP
SCIENCE
THAT'S IT <BREATH>
NO
AND A PENCIL <BREATH>
I THINK I CHANGED THE LENGTH
IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
UH WE CHANGED IF IT WAS SHORTER IT WOULD GO FASTER AND IF IT WAS LONGER IT WOULD GO SLOWER
WE SWUNG IT SIDEWAYS AND SAW HOW MUCH HOW MANY TIMES YOU CAN SWING BACK AND FORTH FIFTEEN IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
GOOD
I FORGET
YEP
<BREATH> IT'S NOT GOING THE SAME DISTANCE IT DID AT THE LAST STARTING POSITION
BECAUSE UH IF MAY BE IF IT CHANGES THE LENGTH IT COULD GO FASTER
I DON'T REMEMBER
UH IT'S HANGING FROM A TABLE
UM I THINK SO YOU CAN SEE YOUR RESULTS
I DON'T REMEMBER
YES
SO WHEN YOU MAKE AN ESTIMATE UH YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HELP YOU GET THE ANSWER
THE LENGTH OF THE STRING
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON PENDULUMS
IT LOOKS LIKE A GRAPH FROM UH SH BIGGEST TO LITTLEST
UM THE LENGTH OF THE STRING
GOOD
UH IN FIFTEEN SECONDS THEY THE THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETER STRING JUST SWINGS TWELVE TIMES NO MATTER WHAT
I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
UM I FORGET
THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK OF
I THINK IT'S ABOUT UM SUBTRACTING
IT TELLS ME THAT THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IS GETTING UH SH LOWER
I DON'T KNOW
UM IF I THINK IF YOU PUT ANOTHER PENNY AND IT'LL STILL BE THE SAME EXACT AMOUNT
YES
IF IT'S SHORTER IT GOES MORE SWINGS BUT IF IT'S LONGER IT GOES LESS SWINGS
UM WELL I THINK THE LABELS ARE THE NUMBERS SO IT GOES UH TO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY
IT'S A GRAPH TO SEE HOW LONG UH THE S PENDULUM IS
IT MAKES THE PENNY IN THE IT MAKES THE PENNY SWING BACK AND FORTH
BYE
UM THEN YOU KNOW THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE BOTTOM THE THEY'LL KNOW WHAT THAT IS THEY WON'T SAY THAT THAT THAT THE BOTTOM LINE <BREATH> IS THE TEMPERATURE CELSIU- DEGREES CELSIUS AND THE AND TIME IS UP AND DOWN IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE THE SAME
YOU COULD USE THAT ZIG ZAGGY GRAPH IF IT GETS <FP> WARMER YOU DRAW THE LINE UP HIGHER IF IT GETS COLDER YOU DRAW IT LOWER
I WOULD DESCRIBE IT ST UP HIGH AND THEN IT GOES ALL PRETTY FAR DOWN AND THEN IT GETS HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER
IF THE RED <FP> UM LIQUID GOES DOWN THEN YOU KNOW THAT IT'S GETTING COLDER IF IT GOES UP IT'S GETTING WARM
THEN IT SLOWLY MAKES IT'S WAY BACK UP TO THE UP THE GRAPH THEN IT GETS WARMER
YOU COULD TELL HOW IT GOES UP AND WELL IT STARTS UP HIGH AND THEN IT GOES DOWN DROPS DOWN REALLY QUICKLY AND THEN IT GETS UP HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER EVENTUALLY
MEASURING TEMPERATURE <BREATH>
UM THE FIRST ONE WAS PRETTY NORMAL THEN THE SECOND ONE WAS PRETTY COLD THE THIRD ONE WAS REALLY HOT AND THE LAST ONE WAS PRETTY HOT PRETTY WARM
GRAPHS ARE HOW TO KEEP TRACK OF SOMETHING HOW TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT
GOOD
TEN MINUTES
IT GETS COLDER
WELL YOU'D HAVE TO WRITE IT DOWN IT DOESN'T JUST SAY WHAT THE ANS- SAY THE DIFFERENCE WAS TEN DEGREES OR SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT YOU HAVE TO WRITE IT DOWN AND THEN SUBTRACT AND ADD AND DO SOME MATH
THE THIRD ONE IS ONE HUNDRED DEGREES AND THE HOTTEST
THE TIME IS AT THE BOTTOM AND HOW MANY AT THE UP UP AND DOWN
<BREATH> UM IF IT GOES DOWN AND THEN IF IT GOES DOWN IT'S COLDER IT'S DROPPING THE TEMPERATURE AND IF IT GOES UP IT'S INCREASING THE TEMPERATURE
IN THIS GRAPH IT DROPS FROM TWENTY TO FIVE <BREATH> THEN UP TO SIX THEN UP TO EIGHT AND THEN UP TO THIRTEEN AGAIN
UM ONCE IT GOT COLDER THEN IT GOT A LITTLE WARMER BECAUSE THE ELS
IT WENT DOWN BUT DIDN'T FULLY GO UP AGAIN <BREATH>
<BREATH> UH ZERO WHEN IT WAS JUST THE NORMAL WATER AND IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY ICE IN YE YET IT WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN DEGREES AND THEN WHEN WE PUT THE ICE IN IT GOT IT DROPPED DOWN AND THEN IT GOT WARMER BECAUSE THE ICE STARTED MELTING AND WARMER AND WARMER AND WARMER
THE INFORMATION OF HOW COLD OR HOT THE WATER WAS WHAT TEMPERATURE AND HOW AND UM AND WHAT TIME THAT TEMPERATURE WAS
AFTER <FP> WE CHECKED THE THERMOMETER EVERY MINUTE
THE FIRST ONE IS TWENTY DEGREES CELSIUS THE SECOND ONE IS FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS THE THIRD IS ONE HUNDRED DEGREES CELSIUS OR BOILING AND THE LAST ONE IS FIFTY FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS
I NOTICED THAT IT STARTS AT TWENTY AND ENDS UP AT THIRTEEN
YOU COULD SUBTRACT YOUR FINISH TIME FROM YOUR FINISH TEMPERATURE FROM YOUR START TEMPERATURE AND THEN YOU COULD GET YOUR ANSWER IN THIS CASE IT WOULD BE FIFTEEN DEGREES
BUT ON A LINE GRAPH ER THAT GRAPH SET <FP> IT HAS NUMBERS AND DAYS ER TIMES AND THEN IT GETS ZIG ZAGGY
IT DROPPED DOWN FROM TWENTY TO FIVE IN JUST A MINUTE
OURS IT WENT FROM TWENTY ALL THE WAY TO FIVE IT WENT REALLY LOW
IT IS ELEVEN NO IT IS TEN DEC DECIMETERS-
I THINK YOU CAN DO IT IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE THE RIGHT UM IF THEY'RE THE RIGHT SIZE IF THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
A METER STICK OR A YARDSTICK OR A RULER THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE
<BREATH> I THINK PEOPLE GOT IN BIG ARGUMENTS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT TO WHAT STANDARDS TO USE AND THEN EVENTUALLY THEY FINALLY AGREED ON SOME C CERTAIN SIZES
ONE THOUSAND
<BREATH> YOU PUT IT AT THE EDGE OF YOUR DESK AND BR- BRING IT ALONG AND PUT IT DOWN AND THEN YOU MARK WHERE IT ENDED WITH YOUR FINGER THEN YOU PICK IT UP AND PUT IT DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR FINGER AND KEEP GOING
YES
YES I DO
IF THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE THEN EVERYONE WILL GET THE SAME ANSWER BUT IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZES THEN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE AS LONG OR THEY MIGHT BE LONGER THAN OTHER ONES SO THEY'LL GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS
SOME OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ONES SO EVERYBODY GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS WITH RULERS YARDSTICKS OR METER STICKS OR SOMETIMES TAPE MEASURES AND OTHER MEASURING TAPES
YOU COULD USE A LOT OF UM YOU COULD USE A BUNCH OF UM RULERS OR YARDSTICKS AND PUT THEM ALL ALONG AND THEN AND THEN UM LOOK AT THE HIGHEST NUMBER AND SEE WHAT IT IS
HELLO
IT'S WORKING
YOU COULD PUT THEM ALONG IN A A ROW MATCHING THEM UP TOGETHER IN A LONG ROW AND THEN YOU COULD FIGURE OUT HOW LONG IT IS
WE WERE MEASURING UM OUR DESK AND WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT THE PERIMETER OF IT
<BREATH> ONE THOUSAND METERS
HELLO MY NAME IS MAX I LIKE TO DO MATH AND MEASUREMENT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
YEP
LENGTH IS HOW LONG SOMETHING IS USUALLY
YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS WITH THOSE AND I THINK THEY'RE STRAWS
<BREATH> IT IS ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS LONG
WE HAVE BEEN MEASURING I MEAN NO IN MATH WE'VE BEEN DOING UM MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
<BREATH> HOW BIG IT IS
IT IS WHEN YOU UM NEED IF YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO NE IF YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW LONG OR BIG SOMETHING IS YOU MEASURE IT AND THEN YOU CAN KNOW WHAT HOW BIG IT IS
THAT THEY ARE ONE HUNDRED METERS I THINK
YEAH
BYE
I USED A YARDSTICK BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT SIZE FOR MY DESK
YES
THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IN A METER AND THERE ARE TEN DEC DECIMETERS IN A METER ALSO
THE THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS THERE MEANS THAT THAT CAN OF ORANGE SODA HAS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF ORANGE SODA
GOOD
CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN HOLD LIKE A CUP OR A WATER BA-
IT'S THIRTY THREE IT'S A THIRTY THREE MILLILITER DIFFERENCE IT'S NOT RIGHT
YOU WOULD ADD UP THE MMM THE LITER THE UM MILLILITERS THAT YOU HAVE
IT'S NOT ENTIRELY FULL THE REAL *CAMPACITY* OF THE CAN IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS BUT <FP> HOW MUCH IT HAS IN IT SINCE IT'S NOT FULL TO THE TOP IS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS NOT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE
YOU COULD FILL IT UP WITH WATER AND THEN SUCK IT UP ER NO YOU TAKE A UM <FP> A SYRINGE AND FILL IT UP WITH WATER THEN SQUIRT IT IN THE IN THE CAN AND THEN YOU JUST KEEP FILLING UP THE SYRINGE AND SQUIRTING IT IN THE CAN AND FILLING IT UP FROM THE WATER BOTTLE OR SOMETHING AND SQUIRTING IT IN THE CAN AND YOU JUST KEEP DOING THAT UNTIL IT'S FULL AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW MANY SYRINGES AND THEN YOU ADD 'EM ALL UP AND THEN AND THEN YOU GET YOUR ANSWER
THE *CAMPACITY* OF THAT CUP WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
YOU CAN MEASURE THE *CAMPACITY* OF A CAN
YOU COULD USE THE SYRINGE AND SUCK IT UP AND THEN S AND THEN GET ANOTHER SYRINGE AND SUCK IT UP AND THEN ADD UP A THE SYRINGES AMOUNT AND THEN YOU WOULD GET YOUR ANSWER
VOLUME IS HOW MUCH IS IN IT LIKE THE SODA CAN MIGHT ONLY BE HALFWAY FULL BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT THAT THIRSTY OR YOU DRANK HALF OF IT BUT THE CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD IN ALL
WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH CAM WHAT THE *CAMPACITY* OF A SODA CAN WAS
THAT TELLS YOU THAT MUCH WATER IS IN THE GRADUATED CYLINDER
<BREATH> IT'S NOT THE REAL *CAMPACITY* BECAUSE THE REAL CAPACITY IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS IT ONLY HAS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS IN IT IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS MORE TO BE FULL
IT'S LABLED TEN MILLILITERS THROUGH ONE HUNDERED MILLILITERS
THERE'S THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS <FP> IN THE THE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS IS THE *CAMPACITY* OF THE ORANGE SODA CAN
THE NUMBER IS THE VOLUME OF THE CUP
UM IF YOU ONLY HAVE ONE SYRINGE BUT A BUNCH OF GRADUTAT- GRADUATED CYLINDERS YOU COULD SUCK UP WATER IN THE SYRINGE AND THEN SPRAY IT IN THE ONE GRADUATED CYLINDER AND KEEP WATER IN THE GRADUATED CYLINDER AND THEN KEEP SOME IN THE SYRINGE
IF THE ORANGE SODA CAN WAS FULL THEN IT'S ACTUALLY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS WHICH MEANS THAT THEY THAT'S THE *CAMPACITY* AND IT'S THE VOLUME
IT'S NOT FULL TO THE TOP
THE VOLUME AND THE *CAMPACITY* ARE THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS AP- DIFFERENCE
THAT'S PROBABLY THE *CAMPCITY* OF THE CAN
VOLUME IS HOW MUCH THERE IS INSIDE OF THE CAN LIKE THERE WAS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS IN THE CAN <COUGH> BUT THE *CAMPACITY* IS HOW MUCH IT CAN FILL HOW MUCH WHAT'S THE ENTIRE HOW IF IT'S ENTIRELY FULL THAT'S THE *CAMPACITY*
THE *CAMPACITY* IS THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS MORE THAN THE VOLUME
THE STANDARD UNIT IS LITERS AND A S THE SMALLER ONE IS MILLILITERS
<BREATH> THEY EMPTIED OUT THE ENTIRE ORANGE SODA CAN AND THERE'S AND THERE WAS REALLY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS THAT TIME SO THEY MUST HAVE MEASURED WRONG
THAT ONE'S FULL SO THAT'S THE REAL *CAMPCITY* BUT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS NOT FULL SO THAT'S NOT THE FULL *CAMPACITY*
BYE BYE
IT WAS PRETTY BY
THE ONE ON THE RIGHT I MEAN LE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS A BEAKER THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS A GRADUATED CYLINDER AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A SYRINGE
CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH LIQUID A BOTTLE CAN HOLD
IF WE KNOW HOW HOW MUCH UM IS IN THE CAN THEN YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU'RE DRINKING LIKE IF YOU DRANK HALF OF IT S UM THEN YOU'LL KNOW THERE'S THAT YOU DRANK S HALF OF LIKE YOU DRANK HALF OF THE AMOUNT YOU MEASURED LIKE IF THERE'S IF YOU'RE DRINKING A ONE HUNDRED MILLILITER CAN OF SOMETHING AND YOU DRINK HALF OF IT YOU KNOW THERE'S FIFTEEN MILLILITERS LEFT
WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THE *CAMPACITY* OF BOTTLES AND CANS
HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD OR THE *CAPACITY*
YOU GOT TO FILL UP A CUP OF WATER AND THEN POUR IT IN THE GRADUATED CYLINDER AND THEN YOU COULD LOOK YOU PUT THE GRADUATED CYLINDER DOWN UNTIL THE WATER LEVEL'S OUT AND THEN LOOK AT WHAT LINE IT'S ON AND THEN YOU CAN KNOW HOW MUCH IT WA HOW MUCH WHAT THE CAPACITY OF THE CUP WAS
WE MEASURED THE CAMPA CAPACITY OF A CUP
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A BEAKER YOU CAN HOLD STUFF INSIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW HOW FULL IT IS PRETTY MUCH
YOU COULD POUR IT IN A DIFFERENT CUP OR A GRADUATED CYLINDER OR SOMETHING
A TALL ONE COULD BE TALLER AND SKINNY AND THEN THE SHORT ONE COULD BE SHORT BUT REALLY REALLY WIDE SO IT A SHORTER ONE COULD HOLD LOTS AND LOTS MORE THAN THE UM THAN THE TALL AND SKINNY ONE
IT'S HOLDING ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
YOU COULD USE A AND B YOU KNOW THAT'S FIFTY SO THEN C AND D ARE THE SAME LENGTH APART SO THAT IS PROBABLY A HUNDRED ABOUT
THE LINES TELL YOU HOW MANY MILLILITERS IT'S HOLDING
THE CUP THE *CAPACITY* OF THE CUP WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS
YOU CAN MEASURE THE CAPACITY *CAPACITY* OF SOMETHING OF A CUP OR A WATER BOTTLE OR SOMETHING
THINK ABOUT THE CAPACITY OF SOMETHING YOU ALREADY MEASURED UM AND THEN YOU CAN THINK OF WHAT IT IS OF AND LOOK AT THE SIZE DIFFERENCE AND THEN YOU CAN ESTIMATE PRETTY WELL
BYE
IT'S A LITER
THE TALL CUP IS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
YOU SHOULD MEASURE ALL THE WATER IN THE CUP
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS MATTER UM WHAT SHAPE IT IS SOMETIMES THEY'RE SKINNY OR WIDE OR TALL OR SHORT IT DOESN'T MATTER TALL AND SKINNY MIGHT BE THE SAME *CAPACITY* AS SHORT AND WIDE
CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN HOLD HOW MUCH A SPONGE CAN HOLD HOW MUCH A CUP CAN HOLD HOW MUCH A WATER BOTTLE CAN HOLD HOW MUCH S SOME HOW MUCH SOMETHING SOMETHING CAN HOLD
YOU COULD ESTIMATE THE MORE YOU TRY WITH A LITER OR A BEAKER OR SOMETHING THE BETTER AT ESTIMATING YOU'LL GET AND YOU CAN AND THEN YOU CAN ESTIMATE
WE COULD USE A SYRINGE
WE USED UM THE *CAPACITY* OR
GRADUATED CYLINDER
WE HAD TO MEASURE THE CAPACITY OF THE CUP
THOSE ARE VESSELS LIKE LITTLE CONTAINERS THAT ARE TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS IN CAPACITY
YOU CAN STICK THE PART ONE PART IN THE WATER AND THEN YOU PULL OUT YOU PULL THE LITTLE HANDLE THING AND IT SUCKS UP THE WATER AND IF YOU PUSH IT BACK THE HANDLE BACK IN THEN IT SPRAYS THE WATER OUT
THE ONES THAT WE USED WERE FIFTY MILLI MILLILITERS
IT'S YOUR IT'S HOW IT'S THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CUP
<BREATH> IT WAS MORE SHORT IT WAS SHORTER AND MORE WIDE BUT IT WAS STILL TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
GOOD
YOU FILL IT UP WITH WATER AND THEN YOU CAN POUR THAT IF OR YOU CAN YOU CAN SUCK IT UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND THEN YOU KNOW THAT'S FIFTY UH FIFTY MILLILITERS AND THEN YOU CAN FILL UP A GRADUATED CYLINDER I MEAN YOU CAN TAKE THE SYRINGE AND SPRAY THE WATER IN THE GRADUATED CYLINDER AND THEN FILL UP THE SYRINGE AGAIN AND PUT IT IN A BUCKET AND KEEP SUCKING UP AND SPRAYING BUT YOU RECORD IT AND THEN YOU CAN ADD UP YOUR RESULTS
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE WERE WE HAVE BEEN DOING AIRPLANES WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IS THE AIRPLANE PROPELLER CAN FLY
I THINK THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHAT MAKES IF FLY IS THE PROPELLER MAKES IT FLY AND THAT THE STRING IS BALANCED AND A AND THAT THE STRAW IS GREAT IS PUT GOOD ON IT
YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLER IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN
SO IF THE STRING IS S STRAIGHT UP OR IT A IT'S NOT IT'S GONNA GO DOWN BECAUSE IF YOU START FROM THE TOP IT'S GONNA GO DOWN AND IF YOU START FROM THE STRAIGHT IT'S GONNA GO REALLY FAST BUT IF YOU GO DOWN IT'S GONNA STOP IN THE MIDDLE SO IT'S NOT REALLY GONNA WORK
THANK YOU
OKAY SO HOW MANY SPINS IT TAKES SPINS ARE FORTY FIVE SPINS IT MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT
SO WHAT THE PARTS OF THE P PLANE IS THE PROPELLER IS GOING AROUND AND AROUND AND THE BOTTOM THING GET HOLDS THE PROPELLER THIS THE TWO STRAWS ARE MAKING IT BALANCE AND THE THE UM THE THE POPSICLE STICK IT'S IS MAKING THE PROPELLER STAY TOGETHER ON IT AND TO MAKE IT GO FAST
I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLER SPIN AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE RUBBER BAND IN THE BOTTOM IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK
YOU
YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE THE PROPELLER YOU CAN USE FISHING YOU CAN USE FISHING WIRE AND YOU CAN MAKE THE PROPELLER SMALLER YOU CAN MAKE THE THE
SO IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARTY
THE DIFFERENT DISTANCE COULD BE ONE COULD BE IT HAS TO BE BALANCED AND TWO THE PROPELLER HAS TO BE GOOD PUT IT IN THE S IN THE HAS TO BE PUT IN IT AND ALSO
THANK YOU
OKAY SOME PEOPLE ARE EXPERIMENTING THAT IF THE FIRST ONE IS GOING STRAIGHT AND IT'S GOING FARTHER BUT THE BOTTOM ONE IS STOPPING AND IT'S NOT GOING THAT WELL BECAUSE THE PROPELLER IS STOPPING IT'S NOT MOVING THAT WELL AND SO THE FIRST ONE IS GOING STRAIGHT AND IT'S GOING PERFECT
I THINK WHEN SETTING UP YOUR MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICKY TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND
WHEN IT SPINS THE THING ON THE BOTTOM SPINS AROUND TOO WITH IT AND M AND THEN YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH FAR IT WENT
I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT IT
TO FLY A PLANE UM IT HAS TO THE STRING HAS TO BE BALANCED RIGHT HAS TO BE STRAIGHT IT CAN'T BE WIGGLY CAUSE IT'S IF IT'S WIGGLY IT'S GONNA STOP IT AND IT'S NOT GONNA GO THAT FAR
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PROPELLER IS THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND PROPELLER KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND
YEAH IT DOES MEAN THAT BECAUSE THIS THIS FLIGHT LOG ISN'T REALLY CORRECT BECAUSE IT SAYS TWENTY TWO SPINS IN TWO METERS AND IT'S NOT REALLY THAT FAR BECAUSE IF IT SAID TEN METERS THEN ONE METER IT'S NOT RIGHT
IT'S GOING VERY WELL MARTY
I THINK THE NUMBER OF SWINGS ISN'T RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HA ALSO THE STRING HAS TO BE BALANCED AND THE PROPELLER HAS TO BE MOVING
I THINK WAS THE I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL IMPORTANT ABOUT WOULD BE CHANGING THE PROPELLER AND SEEING AND MAKING IT SHORTER OR LONGER AND I'M GUESSING YOU CAN USE THE RUBBER BAND INSTEAD OF USING THE RUBBER BAND YOU CAN USE UM S FISHING STRING AND YOU CAN ALSO MAKE THE POPSICLE STICK SHORTER AND TO SEE HOW HOW FAST IT GOES
I THINK WHAT FLYING FAST PLANES IS ALL ABOUT YOU HAVE TO SEE IF IT'S BALANCING AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT BALANCE BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT BALANCED WELL UM WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO BALANCE IT IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN AND WHEN IT GOES DOWN IT'S GONNA STOP SO IT HAS TO KEEP THE BALANCE UP STRAIGHT
SO WHAT THE PARTS OF THE PLANE I USE THE PROPELLER IS MAKING IT SPIN AND THE STRING THE STRAW AND THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT
I THINK IT COULD CONNECT TO THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT WOULD BE WE CAN JUST MEASURE MEASURE 'EM AND IT CAN BE EIGHTY MILLIMETERS OR SIXTY TWO MILLIMETERS THIRTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE MILLIMETERS
I THINK IT C IT'S IT'S THE BIGGEST ONE CAN BE LIKE MORE THING MORE PASSENGERS THAN THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE IF YOU PUT THE SAME NUMBER ON EACH ONE OF 'EM IT WOULD EASILY SINK
NO SOME OF THEM HOLD TEN OR NINE
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDULUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDULUMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOAT
FIRST YOU HAVE TO MEASURE A THE BOAT AND SEE AND PUT IT IN THE WATER AND YOU I THINK YOU MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND THEN YOU'D NEED TO
I THINK IF A HAS MORE PENDULUMS AND B HAS LESS PENDULUMS I THINK IT'S JUST BECAUSE A IS BIGGER AND B IS SHORTER AND IF YOU PUT A TWENTY FIVE PENDULUMS IT WOULDN'T SINK THAT FAST IT WOULDN'T SINK BUT IF YOU PUT B TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE PENDULUMS IT WOULD SINK
THIS DATA IS ALL ABOUT A CAN HOW HOW HOW COME WHAT NUMBER LIKE FOR EXAMPLE A IS THE NUMBER ONE CUP AND HOW MANY WATER OR PENNIES IT CAN HOW MANY WATER IT CAN HOLD AND THEN YOU JUST MEASURE IT AND THEN THE CAPACITY YOU WRITE EIGHTY MILLIMETERS AND ON B IT'S THE SAME THING ON B THE NUMBER B THE CUP AND YOU JUST HOLD SIXTY TWO MILLIMETERS
THE LIFEBOATS ARE ALL ABOUT YOU GO YOU CAN GO ON A ROMANTIC DATE YOU CAN
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU PUT WATER IN NUMBER EIGHT YOU CAN PUT IT WOULDN'T SINK THAT EASILY AND B I THINK MAYBE C YES AND D OF COURSE
WHEN I WHEN I NOTICED THAT A WASN'T DROWNING THAT MUCH I STARTED PUTTING MORE AND MORE UH PENDULUMS IN 'EM AND WHEN I DROWNED IT I I GOT MY ANSWER REALLY EASILY
WE
BYE
ABOUT ELEVEN AND C COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHORTEST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT
WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT CAPACITY WAS I KNOW I KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO MEASURE THEM AND WE HAVE TO SEE WHICH ONE HA HOLDS MORE PENDULUMS OR OR WHICH ONE HOLDS MORE WATER
I'VE BUILT MINE OUT OF PA OUT OF PAPER CUPS
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT PENDULUMS WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO P HOW TO DO SCIENCE AND AND TO LEARN MORE THINGS
LEARN ABOUT O
TAKE AWAY ONE MORE
YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF LIFEBOATS YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF WOOD
I DISCOVERED THAT THE BOAT CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PENDULUMS IN THE LITTLE BOAT
WHY I THINK THEY GOT A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENNIES IS BECAUSE THEY CUTTED THEM SHORTER OR LONGER
I I THINK I'M NOT SURE I THINK YOU HAVE TO MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND WE LEARNED HOW TO HOW MANY PENDULUMS THAT IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD
VERY WELL
I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENNIES IN IT OR WATER
I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS THAT THE FIRST ONE THE LA THE SECOND ONE THE STRING ISN'T WELL DONE AND IT'S NOT PERFECT IT'S NOT STRAIGHT AND THE FIRST ONE IS REALLY STRAIGHT AND IT BALANCES AS IT BALANCES IT IT BALANCE IT BUT THE SECOND ONE DOESN'T BALANCE IT BECAUSE WHEN IT GOES UP IT'S GONNA GO BACK DOWN
I THINK YES THAT THE STRING HAS TO BE BALANCED BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT BALANCED THE STRING MAY FALL AND IT CAN WIGGLE AND MAYBE IT'S NOT GONNA BALANCE HOW YOU WANT IT TO BE AND MAYBE IT'S NOT GONNA WORK BECAUSE THE PROPELLER ISN'T M MOVING 'EM A LOT BECAUSE IT'S WIGGLING
I THINK THAT IF THE STRING ISN'T BALANCED THAT WELL IT'S NOT GONNA WORK IT'S NOT GONNA SPIN IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK
I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE FLYING LINE IS BECAUSE AND IT ATTACHES TO IT AND IT MAKES IT BALANCE AND IF E YOU DON'T HAVE IT ON THE BOTTOM IT'S GONNA NOT GO THAT FAST
I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIRPLANE FLY
OKAY
BYE IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO
THE STRING WAS ALL ABOUT SEEING HOW FAST THE AIRPLANE COULD H FLY AND THE STRING
WITH STRING
I AM VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU MARNIE
-MARNIE
YEAH THAT'S IT
ME TOO
THANK YOU
OKAY
THANK YOU
I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE FLYING YOUR PLANE IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCED AND IT'S NOT WIGGLING A LOT AND THAT YOUR PROPELLER SPINS
I THINK WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS
I THINK THE PROPELLERS ARE ALL ABOUT I AM GUESSING THAT THE PROPELLERS ARE TO KEEP IT BALANCED
UM WELL MAYBE IT'S YOU HAVE TO PUT THE AIRPLANE HANGING ATTACHED TO A STRING AND YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW IF IT CAN FLY
WHAT YOU CAN ALSO DO WHEN THE PARTS ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER IS YOU CAN PUT THE STRING INTO THE STRAW AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SWING IT ACROSS AND IT BALANCE IT AND IF IT DOESN'T BALANCE IT'S GOING TO WIGGLE A LOT
I THINK HOW I MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DONE AND IF IT GOES UP IT'S GONNA GO BACK DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IS GONNA KEEP GOING STRAIGHT
I THINK IT'S
UM YOU CAN FLIP
SYSTEMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOING SEEING SEEING WHAT HOW THE SYSTEM LOOKS
WE HAVE SEEN A FLIPPER SYSTEM
I THINK YOU WOULD JUST BY UM FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SAY THE BROOK HOLDS THE STICK IN AND IT MAKES IT AND YOU MEASURE IT AND IT MAKES IT GO IN
I THINK WHAT THE BASE IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR
I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES
SPINNING THE RUBBERBAND AROUND AND SEEING HOW HOW FAR IT GOES
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS AND WE HAVE BEEN YEAH WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS
I'M VERY GOOD
I THINK WE HAVEN'T
IT MAKES IT A SYSTEM BECAUSE THE PROPELLER'S SPINNING AROUND
I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST IS SEEING SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES AND SEEING THE LI THE BLOCK CAN GO BE HEAVIER
THESE ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND SEEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR
I THINK WHAT YOU CAN CHANGE YOU CAN
I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IT MAKES A GOOD FLIPPER SYSTEM BECAUSE IT BOUNCES OFF AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BOUNCE IT OFF THAT HIGH BECAUSE THE THE STICK CAN BREAK
UM YOU CAN THINK OF
YOU CAN ALSO UM DO A SMALLER STICK AND SEE YEAH YOU CAN DO THAT TOO
IT CONNECTS IT BY PUTTING THE STICK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BRICK AND IF IT GOES FAR YOU JUST PUSH IT IN YOU JUST TAKE IT OUT AND IT'S AND THEN JUST PUT IT
I FOUND OUT THAT YOU GET YOU'RE MEASURING IT AND THAT YOU'RE SEEING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND IF IT DOESN'T GO THAT FAR YOU PUT THE CAPACITY YOU WRITE THE CAPACITY AND YOU
YOU NEED A SOMETHING TO MAKE IT FLIP YOU NEED YOU NEED A STICK AND TO MEASURE IT
I THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UM SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES MAYBE
THERE IS SOMETHING ON THE ON TOP OF IT AND THAT YOU HOLD IT YOU PUT IT UNDER THE BLOCK AND YOU JUST FLIP IT AND YOU SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE GOOD IN HAVE TO PUT IN GOOD AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT WELL DONE THEY CAN BREAK
GOOD BYE
UM YOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT HOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER
WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BOUNCES OFF
A DECOMPOSER EATS THE CONSUMER
THE CONSUMER THE ONE THAT EATS THE PRODUCER AND THEN IT GETS MORE ENERGY
IT'S ABOUT PRETTY MUCH THE PRODUCERS PRETTY MUCH THE PRODUCERS ARE PLANTS PLANTS AND THE CONSUMERS ARE MEAT EATERS AND BUT WHAT THE THEN DECOMPOSERS ARE PRETTY MUCH THE THE ONES THAT EAT THE WASTE
THINK THE PRODUCERS ARE THE GRASS AND THE MUSHROOMS AND THE BACTERIA AND AND THE PINE CONE AND THAT'S ALL
THEY GET THEIR ENERGY CAUSE THEY EAT THE PRODUCER
I THINK I THINK THIS I THINK I THINK IT IS ABOUT COMPOSERS DECOMPOSERS AND SECONDARY COMPOSERS OR
GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE CONSUMER BECAUSE THEY EAT THE CONSUMER
I DON'T I THINK THIS SHOWS
BACTERIA AND FUNGI
I AM LEARNING ABOUT CATERPILLARS AND DECOMPOSERS AND COMPOSERS
GOOD
<NOISE>
<NOISE>
IT'S ABOUT ALL THE ANIMALS EATING EACH
FUNGI (())
FINISH IT I STILL HAVE TO FINISH IT OKAY CARNIVORES OMNIVORES DECOMPOSERS WHAT
COMPOSERS DECOMPOSERS AND SECONDARY DECOMPOSERS
A PRIMARY A RABBITS ONE OF THE PRIMARY CONSUMER
OMNIVORES EAT BERRIES AND
WHAT I THINK THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS A FOOD WEB
COMPOSERS DECOMPOSERS AND SECONDARY DECOMPOSERS
A CARNIVORES DOES NOT JUST EAT
BEING A COMPOSERS YOU EAT THE PRODUCERS SO THAT'S HOW THEY GET THEIR
THE CONSUMERS ARE THE BUNNY AND THE BIRD AND THE LIZARD
THEY GET THEIR ENERGY BY EATING THE THE PRODUCER THE PRODUCER HAS THEIR ITS ENERGY IT EATS
IT'S THE ONE THAT EATS PLANTS
THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
IT DOESN'T UHM IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T UHM LIKE EAT ANYTHING LIKE LIKE AN ANIMAL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT GETS ITS OWN ENERGY BY THE SUN
PRETTY MUCH WE TALK ABOUT DECOMPOSERS CONSUMERS PRETTY MUCH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UHM CONSUMERS DECOMPOSERS AND AND PRODUCERS
<DISCARD>
(())
IT'S THE ONE THAT EATS PLANTS AND
A CONSUMER IS THE ONE THAT EATS THE PRODUCER TO GET ITS ENERGY
MEAT
IT'S UHM PRODUCERS CONSUMERS PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND CONSUMERS IT'S PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND DECOMPOSERS
THIS CONSUMERS ARE HERBIVORES AND CARNIVORES AND DETRIVORES AND LIKE OMNIVORES OH MY GOD OMNIVORES
PLANTS
THEY GET THEIR OWN
THESE ARE PRODUCERS AND THESE THE CONSUMERS AND THESE ARE THE DECOMPOSERS
THE PRODUCERS DECOMPOSERS AND CONSUMERS
DECOMPOSER EATS THE CONSUMER TO GET ITS ENERGY BECAUSE WHEN THE CONSUMER'S DEAD THEN THE DECOMPOSER COMES AND AND EATS UHM THE EATS THE CONSUMER AND THEN LIKE FOR EXAMPLE LETS SAY A BEAR DIED THEN I THINK FUNGI OR A BACTERIA WILL COME TO KILL IT NOT TO KILL IT TO EAT IT
I THINK IS THIS WHAT UHM WHAT THEY EAT AND WHAT THEY GET EATEN BY AND WHAT THEY GET KILLED BY AND STUFF
HERBIVORES EAT PLANT
CONSUMER EATS THE PRODUCER
THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE CONSUMER BECAUSE THE CONSUMER EATS THE PRODUCER
GREAT
CARNIVORE EATS MEAT
MAYBE SOME OF THEM BECAUSE SOME OF THEM ARE HERBIVORES SOME OF THEM ARE CARNIVORES AND THE OMNIVORES ARE
CARNIVORES EAT MEAT
A PRODUCER MEANS TO ME LIKE IT MEANS TO ME THAT IT MAKES ITS OWN FOOD IT DOESN'T EAT LIKE SOMETHING IT GETS ITS ENERGY FROM THE SUN
I THINK THEY ARE PART IN THE FOOD WEB BECAUSE LIKE IF BACTERIA OR FUNGI DIDN'T EXIST THEN THERE WOULD BE LIKE LOTS OF DEAD LIKE JUST DEAD WASTE OVER AROUND EVERYWHERE
THEY UHM MOSTLY ANIMALS THAT EAT EACH OTHER TO GET THEIR ENERGY SO LIKE FOR EXAMPLE (()) GRASS UHM THE BUNNY EATS THE (()) GRASS AND UHM THEN MAYBE A WOLF EATS BUNNY AND AND A BUNNY AND THE WOLF GETS EATEN BY A BEAR AND THEN THE BEAR UHM THE BEAR HAS A LOT OF ENERGY BECAUSE ONE EATS THE SUN AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE ANIMAL IT JUST ATE
IT'S ABOUT PRODUCERS UHM PRETTY MUCH PLANTS AND UHM THEY'RE GET THEIR OWN FOOD AND THE CONSUMERS THEY EAT THE PRODUCER SO THEN THEY HAVE MORE ENERGY
THEY ARE UHM THE GROW GET ENERGY
I THINK IT'S ABOUT UHM IT'S ABOUT FOOD WEB
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIGEST
(())
THEY WORK TOGETHER TO SUPPORT THE HUMAN BODY
I REMEMBER THAT UM THE LIKE POINTED OTHER PARTS OF EARTH
I SEE DESERTS AND OTHER LANDS THAT MOSTLY HAVE ANIMALS
THERE'S THE MOTOR THE MOTOR'S ONE OF THE PARTS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART TO MAKE THE CAR RUN
THEY'RE ALL SYSTEM
THEY WORK TOGETHER
EVERYTHING SUPPORTS THE CAR
THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAR WORK
GOOD
I THINK A FOOD WEB MEANS TO ME THAT UM IT'S A WEB UM THINGS ARE EATEN BY OTHER ANIMALS
THIS IS A PART OF THE SYSTEM
I THINK IT'S ABOUT THINGS EATING THINGS LIKE ANIMALS EATING OTHER PLANTS
IT'S TELLING YOU WHAT WHAT PART OF THE SYSTEM IT IS
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON SYSTEMS
THEY'RE LIKE SAYING WHAT THE ANIMALS THING IS
THE SYSTEM
EACH OTHER
IT'S A SYSTEM
IT TELLS YOU THINGS THAT THEY IT HAS
WE'VE BEEN MAKING (()) FOR OUR RED (())
IT SHOWS LIKE LIKE PLANTS OR ANIMALS THAT ARE I STILL NEED IT BUT YOU CAN BORROW IT UM IT'S UM IT'S A LIKE IT MEANS TO ME THAT UM IT'S JUST THINGS THAT ARE BEING EATEN BY OTHER THINGS
THIS WHOLE BODY IS A SYSTEM
DRY
BLAH
NO LIGHT
LOOKS LIKE UM A UM A FOOD CHAIN
THE ANIMALS BEING LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THIS GRASS SAYS (()) POINTS THE ARROW TO THE BUNNY AND THAT MEANS THAT UM THE BUNNY EATS THAT GRASS
I THINK IT'S AN OCEAN AND ISLAND
I NOTICED THAT UM LOTS OF BUGS HAVE LOTS OF ENERGY
THE EARTH IS PRETTY MUCH HAVE EVERYTHING TO MAKE IT A SYSTEM
THE BIOSPHERE IS THE LAND
I THINK EARTH IS A SYSTEM BECAUSE IT HAS COUNTRIES AND THINGS AND THAT WHAT MAKES IT A SYSTEM
<SILENCE>
IT'S LIKE LIGHTING UP
A HUMAN BODY IS A SYSTEM
MAYBE IT REPRESENTS THE YELLOW MUST REPRESENT THAT IT'S LIKE DRY AND THE BLUE OR PURPLE MEAN IT'S PRETTY COLD
THEY ALL HAVE SOME THEY ALL HAVE LAND
IT'S MADE OUT OF OUT OF THE EARTH
A CIRCUIT IS A CIRCLE OF ELECTRICITY BASICALLY
THE NEGATIVE SIDE APPARENTLY THE ELECTRONS JUST DON'T WANNA BE IN THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
THE THE ENERGY FLOWS ABOUT TWO TIMES FASTER
<BREATH> THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING FASTER
THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW F THR- THE WIRE HAVE HAS TO UM
WELL IN THIS *SHCEMATIC* THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES AND TWO LIGHT BULBS
ONE CIRCUIT HAS TWO DIMLY LIT LIGHT BULBS THE OTHER CIRCUIT HAS ONE BRIGHTLY LIT LIGHT BULB
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WELL THE LIGHT BULBS ARE MORE BRIGHTLY LIT BECAUSE THE ELECTRONS ARE MOVING NO THE ELECTRICITY IS MOVING FASTER AND IN THE OTHER ONE THE ELECTRICITY IS MOVING SLOWER SO THE LIGHT BULBS AREN'T VERY BRIGHTLY LIT THEY'RE DIMLY LIT
THE ENERGY IS GOING FASTER
THE LIGHT BULBS GLOW BRIGHTER
THE BULBS LIGHT UP BRIGHTER SO IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE D CELL YOU GET MORE LIGHT
WELL THE FLOW ISN'T VERY LARGE TO THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB SHARES ITS ELECTRICITY WITH ANOTHER LIGHT BULB IF THE LIGHT BULB DIDN'T SHARE ITS ELECTRICITY WITH ANOTHER LIGHT BULB THERE WOULD BE MORE ELECTRON MORE MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWING TO THE LIGHT BULB AND IT WOULD BE BRIGHTER
WELL I THINK THERE ARE LESS ELECTRONS FLOWING TO EACH UM LIGHT BULB IN THE CIRCUIT WITH WITH THE THE ONE WITH TWO LIGHT BULBS UM THERE'S LESS ELECTRICITY FLOWING TO THE LIGHT BULBS IN THE OTHER ONE THERE IS A BUNCH OF ELECTRICITY FLOWING TO THE LIGHT BULB
WELL UH BYE
WELL THE ELECTRICITY'S UM IS GOING TH THROUGH THE WIRES FRO UM THROUGH THE WIRES FROM THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULBS <BREATH> AND THE LIGHT BULBS AREN'T YOU SEE ONE LIGHT BULB GETS THE SAME AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY AS THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WHICH IS NOT VERY MUCH WHEN YOU HAVE MULTIPLE RECEIVERS BUT IF YOU HA ONLY HAVE ONE RECEIVER THERE'S A LOT MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWING TO THE ONE LIGHT BULB SO IT'S MORE BRIGHTLY LIT
WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS IS FLOWING AROUND THE CIR- THIS CIRCUIT AND THE THE THE LIGHT BULB ISN'T GETTING THAT MUCH ELECTRICITY THE LIGHT BULBS ARE ONLY GETTING LIKE THREE THREE ELECTRONS AT A TIME
WELL IN THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT WITH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS THE LIGHT BULBS AREN'T LIT VERY BRIGHTLY IN THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT WITH ONE LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULB IS SHINING BRIGHTLY
THE LIGHT BULBS GET BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FASTER
IT'S FLOWING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
WELL WHEN YOU ADD MORE SOURCES OF ELECTRICITY
WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW FROM THE
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
THE SIDE IT ALWAYS FLOWS AWAY FROM IS THE POSITIVE SIDE
WELL PLUS IS AGAINST PLUS AND MINUS IS POINTING OUT
WELL THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE LIGHT BUL- UM THROUGH THE WIRES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND THEN BACK TO THE BATTERY
WELL WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE D CELL THE
THEY REPRESENT ELECTRONS AND THERE ARE ONLY LIKE THREE OF THEM IN THE LIGHT BULB AT A TIME
THROUGH A PATHWAY TO A RECEIVER AND BACK AGAIN
WELL THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRONS ARE MOVING FASTER AND THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER
THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FASTER
WELL IN THIS CIRCUIT THE BATTERY GIVES OFF AN ELECTRON THAT GOES THROUGH THE PATHWAY TO THE LIGHT BULB THROUGH ANOTHER PATHWAY AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
WELL
WHEN YOU FLIP IT AROUND THE THE DI THE DIRECTION OF ELECTRICITY GOES THE DIFFERENT GOES THE OPPOSITE WAY
WELL THE PATHWAY IS A CONDUCTOR OR A WIRE
WELL WITH TWO BATTERIES THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FASTER THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULBS VERY FAST AND IT GOES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS VERY FAST AND THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GLOWING BRIGHTER
THROUGH A L F THROUGH A WIRE AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
WELL THE D CELL UM GIVES OFF THE EL ELECTRON THAT STARTS THE FLOW OF ELECTRONS ALL UM THROUGH THROUGH A WHOLE CIRCUIT IT'S PRETTY COOL HOW IT WORKS
WELL THERE'S A LOT OF THE L UM THERE'S A LOT OF FAST ELECTRICITY FLOWING TO THE LIGHT BULBS SO THEY LIGHT BRIGHTER THAN WITH ONE D CELL WHERE THE ELECTRICITY JUST ISN'T FLOWING VERY FAST AND WELL THAT'S ABOUT ALL I CAN SAY
WELL A CONDUCTOR IS A AN OBJECT THAT CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY <BREATH> FROM THE SOURCE TO THE RECEIVER
NO NOT ALL WER- OBJECT WORK THE SAME SOME OBJECTS ARE CONDUCTORS OTHERS ARE INSULATORS
WELL THERE ARE TWO CERTAIN METALS THAT ATTRACT *MAGNENTS* IRON AND STEEL
WELL UM IRON AND STEEL ARE
THEY'RE EITHER IRON OR STEEL
A CIRCUIT TO BE INCOMPLETE OR OPEN WHEN AN INSULATOR IS ADDED AND I WOULD CONSIDER A CIRCUIT <FP> TO BE
WHEN YOU ADD AN INSULATOR TO A CIRCUIT THE THE CIRCUIT IS OPEN
WELL INSULATORS THEY THEY DO NOT TRANSMIT ELECTRONS THROUGH THEM
IT DOESN'T SPIN
WELL THE ELECTRICITY WILL FLOW F FROM THE SOURCE IN THIS CASE THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE C THE UM THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE CONDUCTOR AND THEN THE CONDUCTOR WILL HAVE THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH IT TO ANOTHER WIRE HOOKED UP TO THE MOTOR ANOTHER *WILE* WILL RUN FROM THE MOTOR TO THE BATTERY
BYE
YEAH
WELL THIS IS A CIRCUIT WITH A SWITCH IN IT
GOOD
WELL JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING HERE THAT IS METAL IS A CONDUCTOR EVERYTHING THAT ISN'T METAL IS AN INSULATOR
WELL THE CIRCUIT IS OPEN WHEN THE CIRCUIT HAS AN INSULATOR IN IT IF THE CIRCUIT HAS A CONDUCTOR IN IT THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED AND IF I SAID CLOSED WHEN THERE'S AN INSULATOR IN THE CIRCUIT I MEANT OPEN WHEN THERE'S AN INSULATOR IN THE CIRCUIT
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
WELL AN INSULATOR IS SOMETHING THAT AN INSULATOR IS SOMETHING THAT ELECTRICITY DOES NOT FLOW THROUGH SUCH AS A SPONGE OR A ROCK
A CLOSED CIRCUIT
THE BRASS RING IS A CONDUCTOR
THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL METAL LIKE BRASS OR SILVER OR COPPER METAL IRON STEEL ALUMINUM
WELL UM ALL THE ALL THE OBJECTS THAT WELL THE THEY THEY DIDN'T REALLY WORK AT ALL
WELL WHEN YOU ADD A CONDUCTOR TO THE CIRCUIT THE CIRCUIT BECOMES COMPLETED IF YOU ADD AN INSULATOR TO THE CIRCUIT WELL THE CIRCUIT REMAINS INCOMPLETED
WELL SOMETIMES IT'S REALLY EASY TO GUESS WHERE THE WIRE IS OTHER TIMES IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARDER
GOOD
WELL WE'VE BEEN BUILDING CIRCUITS
YOU HAVE TO TOUCH THE WIRES TO THE BRADS THAT ARE CONNECTING THE WIRE
THIS WOULD BE A CLOSED OR COMPLETE CIRCUIT
WELL YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE WIRES ARE IN THE LITTLE BOARD IT'S A PRETTY COOL EXPERIMENT
YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE BRADS DON'T YOU
WELL YOU COULD TR- YOU COULD TRY A TO B A TO C A TO D IF NONE OF THOSE WORK TRY B B TO A B TO C B TO D IF NONE OF THOSE WORK C TO A C TO B C TO D IF NONE OF THOSE WORK D TO C D TO A D TO B
WELL HERE WE HAVE A BATTERY WIRES
IT TELL ME IT TELLS ME THAT BRADS A AND C ARE CONNECTED BY THE WIRE SO THAT IF YOU TOUCH THE WIRES TO BRAD A AND C THEN YOU GET THE LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP
THERE'S THERE'S A WIRE GOING FROM POINT A TO POINT D
WELL IT COMPLETES THE CIRCUIT FROM THIS SET UP
WELL THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS IN A CIRCLE FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE WIRE TO THE LIGHT BULB THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THROUGH THE WIRES AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
WELL TH THE WIRE IS TOUCHING THE TWO BRADS THAT YOU'VE TOUCHED TO YOUR WI- YOUR WIRES TO IT'S PRETTY COOL HOW IT WORKS
WELL THE WIRE HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE THE METAL BRADS AND THEN IF YOU HAVE THE AND IF YOU HAVE THE UH WIRES ON THE RIGHT BRADS THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT UP
THEY'RE MADE OF METAL AND ARE GOOD CONDUCTORS AREN'T THEY
WELL THE WIRE MUST BE FROM GOING TH THE WIRE OF THE MYSTERY BOARD MUST BE GOING FROM POINT A TO POINT B
THEY'RE CONDUCTORS AREN'T THEY
BYE
THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES FROM THE D CELL TO THE LIGHT BULB
WELL IT'S SHOWING WHERE THE *WIRED* YOU'RE TRYING TO GUESS IS SO IN THIS SET UP IT'S GOING FROM BRAD A TO BRAD B
WELL YOU HAVE TO CONNECT THE WIRES ON THE MYSTERY BOARD SO THAT THEY'RE TOUCHING THE BRADS THAT THE WIRE YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND <BREATH> IS RIGHT THERE
GOOD
A MOTOR
A LIGHT BULB
A MOTOR USES ELECTRICITY TO UM TURN SOMETHING POSSIBLY A WHEEL POSSIBLY ANYTHING THAT SPINS REALLY AND THEN SOME TIMES THE MOTOR IS USED TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY WELL ACTUALLY A MOTOR IF YOU TURN ITS FUNCTION AROUND IT WILL IT WILL
DON'T KNOW
WE'VE WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM AND AND ELECTRICITY VERY COOL ONLY WE'VE WE'VE STARTED TO GET INTO THE ELECTRICITY MORE WE WERE DOING MAGNETISM EARLIER
WELL IT REPRESENTS A MOTOR
THE MOTOR IS JUST SPINNING AROU- UM THE MOTOR IS USING ELECTRICITY TO *SPIN* THE TO SPIN THE ROD THAT THE LITTLE FLAG IS ON
WELL UM A SWITCH UM IT KIND OF CUTS OFF THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING FROM THE D CELL TO THE MOTOR AND THAT'S HOW IT WAS DONE
WELL THE SWITCH UM CUTS OFF THE ELECTRICITY UM GOING FROM THE D CELL TO THE MOTOR WHEN IT'S OFF WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FREELY
WELL IT'S THE SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY FOR THE CIRCUIT UM IT'S BASICALLY THE THING THAT THE CIRCUIT CANNOT WORK WITHOUT
WELL THEY'RE THE PATHWAY THEY'RE WHAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH UM FROM THE BATTERY OR THE SOURCE AND IT'S HOW THE ELECTRICITY GETS GOES FROM THE SOURCE TO THE RECEIVER
WELL THE D CELL ER THE D CELL WELL THE D CELL SENDS THIS THE GIVES OFF THE ELECTRICAL SPARK
THE WIRES
WELL THE BATTERY'S DOWN AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THAT THINGAMABOBBER RIGHT UP THERE
WELL IT'S THE SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY FOR THIS WHOLE CIRCUIT
WELL IT FLOWS FREELY UM FROM THE SOURCE IN THIS CASE THE D CELL THROUGH THE PATHWAY THE WIRES TO THE RECEIVER OR THE MOTOR
A WHITE BULB
IT SHOWS A CIR- A CIRCUIT WITH A SWITCH IN IT A SWITCH OR A CIRCUIT BREAKER
THEY'RE CALLED WIRES
WELL THE SWITCH IS OFF AND OPEN SO THE ELECTRICITY IS CUT OFF THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING TO THE MOTOR IS CUT OFF
UM CAN'T REALLY
IT REPRESENTS A LIGHT BULB
YOU HAVE TO USE THE BATTERY TO
THE SWITCH
THIS COMPONENT IS CALLED THE MOTOR OR RECEIVER
WELL YOU RECEIVE THE ELECTRICITY THEN TRANSMIT IT THROUGH ANOTHER WIRE BACK TO THE SOURCE
WELL THE SYMBOL ON THE BOTTOM OF THE IS THE BATTERY AND THEN THE SYMBOLS THAT KIND OF MAKE THE RECTANGULAR SHAPE THOSE ARE WIRES I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT SYMBOL AT THE TOP IS THOUGH
WHEN IT'S CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT
WELL THE CIRCUIT CAN'T BE BROKEN BY A SWITCH
WELL IT'S USING ELECTRICITY THAT ARE FLOWING THROUGH THE THAT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES TO UH SPIN THE FLAG SPIN THE ROD THAT THE FLAG IS ON
WELL WHEN YOU BY THE SWITCH THE SWITCH IS TURNED ON SO THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FREELY TO THE MOTOR THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE D CELL FLOWS FREELY TO THE MOTOR
THEY CARRY THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY TO THE TO THE SWITCH IN THIS CASE AND THEN TO THE MOTOR OR LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK TO THE D CELL
A D CELL AND A SWITCH
WELL YOU HAVE TO HAVE TWO WIRES COMING FROM THE MOTOR ONE WIRE TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL AND THE OTHER WIRE UM TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
WELL THE SWITCH
DUNNO
A BAT
WELL IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE BRI- BRIGHTER IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT THE LIGHT BULBS ARE DIMMER
WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING MUCH F FASTER ON THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS BECAUSE BOTH LIGHT BULBS ARE OUT THERE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY BY THEMSELVES SO THEY'RE BRIGHTER THAN WHEN EACH LIGHT BULB IS CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND THE OTE- OTHER LIGHT BULB
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY
WELL WHEN YOU ROLL OVER THE LIGHT BULB THE UH WIRES UM GLOW GREEN
GOES THE <FP> IT GOES UM OH IT IT ONLY HAS ONE WAY OF GETTING TO EACH LIGHT BULB WHEREAS IN THE OTHER ONE IT HAS TWO WAYS TO GET TO EACH LIGHT BULB
THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
THE ELECTRICITY ALWAYS FLOWS FROM THE MINUS SIDE OF THE BATTERY
A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE
GOOD HOW HOW ARE YOU
THERE'S ONE FOR EACH RECEIVER
WELL THE UH CIRCLE WITH THE LOOPY THING IN IT IS THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE <BREATH> THE S THE LARGE LINE AND THEN SMALL LINE THAT'S THE BATTERY
A PARALLEL CIRCUIT MEANS THE RECEIVERS EACH HAVE A SEPARATE PATHWAY TO THE BATTERY
IT REPRESENTS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BASICALLY
THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE END AND GOING BACK IN THE POSITIVE END
I THINK YOU'VE MADE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
IT GOES BACK INTO THE D CELL ON THE PLUS OR POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
EACH SYMBOL REPRESENTS A LIGHT BULB A BAT
IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS IN THE OTHER ONE THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY
WELL IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THE BATTERY PRODUCES ELECTRICITY UM WITH TWO WIRES THAT GO THAT GO TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND THEN BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
WELL THIS DRAWING THIS DRAWING SHOWS UM A BATTERY OR A SOURCE A RECEIVER AND ANOTHER RECEIVER IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
WELL A PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS UM HAS WIRES HAS ONE WIRE GOING TO ONE LIGHT BULB ANOTHER WIRE GOING TO ANOTHER LIGHT BULB UM AN FROM AND EACH WIRE'S COMING FROM <FP> UM THE AND THERE ARE OTHER WIRES GOING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO EACH LIGHT BULB
BYE
YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHICH POLE OF A MAGNET IS WHICH BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE THE MAGNET THAT'S O IN THE COMPASS YOU KNOW THAT IT UH POINTS NORTH OR SOUTH WELL TO THE NORTH MAGNETIC OR THE SOUTH MAGNETIC BOTH OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WELL THERE'S A MAGNET HIDDEN SOMEWHERE INSIDE THAT MYSTERY BOX AND YOU HAVE TO FIND USING A FEW TOOLS A PAPER CLIP A MAGNET AND A WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT YOU HAVE TO USE A A A AW WHAT IS IT
WELL THE THE PAPER CLIP WHEN YOU DRAG IT AROUND THE EDGE AND YOU RELEASE THE MOUSE THEN WELL WHEN YOU RELEASE THE MOUSE IT WILL GO TOWARD THE MAGNET IF YOU'RE PRETTY BY TO IT WITH THE MOUSE <BREATH>
WELL THE IRON AND STEEL ARE ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE *MAGNET* AND UH THAT'S ALL I KNOW
BYE
<BREATH> WELL THE MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTED TO IRON
WELL A MAGNET HAS A MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND IT MUCH LIKE THE EARTH AND MAGNETS CAN COME IN A HORSESHOE SHAPE OR A DOUGHNUT SHAPE THOSE ARE THE TWO MOST COMMON SHAPES UM YOU CAN EITHER MAKE UM MAGNETIC OBJECTS TEMPORARY MAGNETS BY RUBBING A MAGNET ON IT OR PRESSING A MAGNET AND LEAVING IT THERE FOR A WHILE IT'S PRETTY COOL MAGNETISM VERY AWESOME
THE NORTH MAGNETIC POLE IS USUALLY SOMEWHERE MAYBE IN THE ARTIC CIRCLE BUT SOMEWHERE WAY UP NORTH BUT IT'S STARTING AROUND IN THE NORTH SO ONE DAY IT MIGHT BE SO ONE DAY IT'S IN GREENLAND BUT THEN IT'S IN RUSSIA THEN ALASKA GREENLAND SO ON SO ON
AND SO IF YOU PUT THE PAPER CLIP NEAR WHERE THE MAGNET IS IT IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET SO IT'LL IT'LL UH MOVE TO WHERE THE MAGNET IS
WELL WHEN YOU PUT THE PAPER CLIP BY TO THE MAGNET YOU SEE WHERE THE MAGNET IS BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP SNAPS TO AND IS ATTRACTED TO THE PAPER CLIP
WELL WE WE DID THIS ES EXPERIMENT IN OUR CLASS AND DURING DIRECTIONS WE PUT MAGNETS INSIDE BOXES FOR OUR GROUP AND SO THAT WAS HOW I KNEW THAT THERE WERE MAGNETS INSIDE THE BOXES THE MYSTERY BOXES ALSO A PAPER CLIP IS A *MAGNETIC* OBJECT AND WE'RE WORKING WITH MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY SO IT'S PRETTY MUCH LITTLE BIT OBVIOUS THAT WE
THE WHAT
<BREATH> WELL THE MAGNETIC POLES OF THE MAGNET UH YOU SEE THE MAGNETIC POLES OF THAT MAGNET THE POLES ON THE MAGNET UM OH GEE WHIZ HOW DO I PUT THIS LET'S SEE SO THE MAGNETIC FIELD WHEN YOU PUT THE PAPER CLIP BY TO IT UM
THERE'S A MAGNET INSIDE THE MYSTERY BOX SO THAT'S WHY IT'S S SO MYSTERIOUS
WELL IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT WAS EITHER IRON OR STEEL SO THAT YOU COULD FIND THE MAGNET WITH IT BECAUSE IRON AND STEEL ARE ATTRACTED TO MAGNETS
WELL THE MAGNETIC FIELD UH WELL IRON AND STEEL ARE ATTRACTED BY THE MAGNETIC FIELD TO ONE OF THE POLES OF THE MAGNET UH YEAH I THINK IT'S I THINK THE I THINK THAT'S ALL I CAN REALLY SAY RIGHT NOW
WELL UM WELL THE THE PAPER CLIP WHEN YOU PUT IT NEAR THE LOWER LEFT HAND CORNER UM IT'S ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET
<BREATH> WELL I SEE THAT UM I SEE THA-
WELL THE UH COMPASS AND YOU MOVE IT WELL THE COMPASS WHEN YOU MOVE IT AROUND THE MAGNET THE NORTH THE NORTH POLE OF THE MAGNET THAT IS PART OF THE COMPASS THE NORTH POLE OF THAT UM POINTS TOWARD THE MAGNET AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY
WELL YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE ONE WIRE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND ONE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY UM IT'S PRETTY C COOL WHEN YOU GET THIS EXPERIMENT TO WORK IN FACT IT'S REALLY COOL EVEN IF YOU DON'T GET IT TO WORK REALLY MUCH AT ALL
WELL THE UM OKAY SO THERE HAS TO BE SOME SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY TOUCHING THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY THAT HAS TO TOUCH THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB SO THE ELECTRONS FLOW FROM THE BATTERY UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB THROUGH THE LITTLE <BREATH> NOTCH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BASE OF THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE ELECTRONS FLOW THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND OUT THE SIDE WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO AND THE AND THEN IT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRE UP THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THE PROCESS IS REPEATED REPEATED REPEATED AND HOWEVER MANY TIMES THE PROCESS REPEATED IT IT'S PRETTY COOL
WELL IT SAYS THAT WIRES ARE THE PATHWAY IT UM MEANS THAT THE WIRES ARE THE PATH FROM THE SOURCE THE D CELL
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM VERY COOL AND UM WE'RE JUST MOVING INTO THE ELECTRICITY UNIT UM WE CREATED AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT WE CREATED AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT YESTERDAY IT WAS COOL
WELL THEY CREATE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF V VOLTS AND THAT WHEN HOOKED UP TO TWO WIRES THAT IS ENOUGH TO POWER A BATTER TO POWER A LIGHT BULB UM AND MAKE A CIR- UH MAKE AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THE ENERGY WILL START OUT FROM INSIDE THE BATTERY GO UP THE WIRE FROM THE PLUS SIDE OF THE BATTERY INTO THE LIGHT BULB IT WILL CIRCLE AROUND AND THEN UP THROUGH THE MINUS SIDE OF THE BATTERY THEN THE CYCLE JUST GOES ON AND ON AND ON SWITCHES BREAK THAT SO THAT MEANS THERE IS NO LIGHT COMING FROM THE LIGHT WHEN THE LIGHT BULB WHEN THE WHEN YOU TURN THE SWITCH OFF IT'S PRETTY COOL WHAT WE DID
WELL ONCE THE D CELL BATTERY UM THERE'RE TWO WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
ELECTRICITY
WELL THE LIGHT BULB IS THE RECEIVER AND IT RECEIVES ALL THOSE ELECTRONS TO CREATE LIGHT AND UM IT ALSO SENDS THOSE ELECTRONS THROUGH ONE THROUGH A BA- THROUGH BACK THROUGH THE WIRE OR THE PATHWAY BACK TO THE SOURCE OR THE BATTERY IT'S PRETTY COOL I MEAN YOU ALSO KIND OF HEAR THE WORD CIRCLE AND THE WORD CIRCUIT AND CIRCLE OF EL A CIRCUIT IS A CIRCLE OF ELECTRICITY
WELL IT'S THE SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY FOR THIS EXPERIMENT WHERE YOU CREATE A CIRCUIT IT'S THE SOURCE OF THE IT'S THE SOURCE OF THE EXPERIMENT <BREATH>
WELL YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A WIRE TO SEND THE ELECTRONS TO THE LIGHT BULB AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A WIRE TO COLLECT THE ELECTRONS FROM THE LIGHT BULB AND IT JUST GOES THROUGH THE BATTERY UP TO THE LIGHT BULB THROUGH AND THROUGH AND IT KEEPS GOING IN THAT CYCLE IT'S PRETTY COOL REALLY COOL
WE'VE BEEN DOING ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
AND AND THEY COLLECT THE AND AND IT COLLECTS THE ELECTRONS THAT FLOW THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THEY KIND OF IT KIND OF
WELL THE LIGHT BULB IS RECEIVING THOSE ELECTRONS THAT TRAVEL THROUGH THE WIRE AND YEAH IT WELL IT RECEIVES THE ELECTRONS THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY COOL RIGHT THERE REALLY COOL HOW IT RECEIVES ALL THOSE ELECTRONS AND SENDS IT BACK THROUGH THE WIRES THEN IT'S S THEN THEY'RE SENT BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THEN BACK OUT BACK THROUGH TO THE LIGHT BULB IT'S PRETTY COOL THE WHOLE CYCLE THE WHOLE CIRCLE
IT GENERATES ELECTRICITY THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH IT UM IT SENDS OFF THAT LITTLE S THE LITTLE FLOW OF ELECTRONS THAT ARE NEEDED FIRST IT GIVES IT A LITTLE SPARK GIVES THIS EXPERIMENT LIFE
THEY'RE WHAT GENERATES THE ELECTRICITY THAT FLOWS AROUND IN THE CIRCLE
WELL IT'S IT UM THE ELECTRONS FALL BACK AND THEN BACK OUT AGAIN IT'S PRETT COOL WHAT IT DOES IT'S VERY INTERESTING
I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU MORE ABOUT IT
GOOD HOW ARE YO HOW IS YOURSELF
WELL IT'S A BATTERY TWO WIRES A LIGHT AND A LIGHT BULB
WELL IT MEANS
GOOD
<BREATH> BECAUSE THERE IS A BUNCH OF BECAUSE THERE IS A BUNCH OF SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS A BUNCH WEAKER THAN THE UM WELL THE ONE WITH ZERO SAY OR THE ONE WITH FOUR
IT MEANS THE FORCE BETWEEN THE MAGNETS IS MUCH MUCH MUCH STRONGER
WELL THERE WAS A BASE MAGNET THAT SIT ON THE SCALE RIGHT OVER NEAR CUP A AND THEN WE HAD ANOTHER MAGNET TO PUT ON TOP OF IT INSIDE CUP A
NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO BYE
UM ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM VERY COOL
WELL IT INCREASES THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS SO THE MAGNETIC PULL BECOMES WEAKER
UM THE WEIGHT IN CUP WELL NO UM <BREATH> YOU SEE THE WEIGHT IN CUP A IS STILL GREATER THAN BUT THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS IS LESS BECAUSE THE MORE SPACE BETWEEN THE MAGNETS THE UM UM UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT I THINK I JUST FORGOT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY
WELL WE WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW MANY WASHERS THAT NEEDED TO BE IN CUP B TO BREAK THE F THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE TWO MAGNETS AND THEN WE ADDED SPACERS TO HELP WELL TO LOWER THE NUMBER OF WASHERS NECESSARY
WELL YOU SHOULD START WITH YOUR CONTROL WITH ZERO SPACERS AND SEE HOW MANY WASHERS IT TAKES TO BREAK THE MAGNETIC POLE
WELL WE HAD A FEW KIDS PASSING OUT UM SPACERS A FEW KIDS PASSING OUT BASE MAGNETS AND A FEW KIDS PASSING OUT THE REGULAR MAGNETS AND A KID PASSING OUT THE CUPS
HMMM WELL GROUP C HAD THE WASHERS ALL IN A JUMBLE BUT THE OTHER THREE GROUPS UM HAD THE WASHERS STACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER SO THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT MORE MAG WASHERS IN BEFORE THE PULL WAS BROKEN AND IN GROUP C THEY ONLY NEEDED FIVE WASHERS CAUSE THE WASHERS WERE ALL IN A JUMBLE SO THEIR WEIGHT THEIR MASS WAS SPREAD OUT ALL AROUND THE CUP SO THEY ONLY NEEDED FIVE
GOOD
IT BECOMES GREATER SO THE MAGNETIC FORCE BECOMES WEAKER MAYBE THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY BEFORE OR MAYBE I WAS JUST UH I DON'T KNOW
WELL THE SPACERS ARE KIND OF BREAKING THE MAGNETIC PULL SO YOU NEED LESS WASHERS
WELL THE MORE OF THEM THERE ARE THE MORE OF THE SPACERS THERE ARE THE LESS WASHERS YOU NEED TO BREAK THE MAGNETIC PULL OF THE MAGNETS
WELL THE RESULTS WERE DIFFERENT RIGHT
HOW ABOUT STACKING THE WASHERS ON TOP OF EACH OTHER SO THAT THE SAME RESULTS WILL COME NINETEEN WASHERS NECESSARY
THE NUMBER OF WASHERS NECESSARY UM DECREASES AS THE NUMBER OF SPACERS INCREASES SO THE MORE SPACERS THERE ARE THE THE WEAKER THE MAGNETIC PULL
WELL THE WASHERS ARE TRYING TO BREAK THE FORCE OF TH THEY'RE TRYING TO BREAK THE MAGNETIC PULL OF THE TWO MAGNETS IN CUP A AND THEN THE SPACERS ARE ALSO TRYING TO HELP BREAK THE MAGNETIC FORCE
WELL IN THIS EXPERIMENT YOU'RE TRYING TO BREAK THE PULL OF THE TWO MAGNETS
IT MUST BE A COMPLETE OR CLOSED CIRCUIT
IT IS A LINE GRAPH OF HOW MANY WASHERS YOU PICK UP AND HOW MANY WRAPS YOU PUT AROUND THE WASHER
THE DATA SHOWS HOW MANY WIRE WRAPS IT TOOK TO UM PICK UP HOW MANY WASHERS
IT TELLS ME THAT IT IS STRONG SOMEWHAT STRONG OR VERY STRONG
BYE
THEY ARE UM MAGNETS POWERED BY ELECTRICITY
WIND UM WIND THE WIRE AROUND THE
WELL THE MORE WINDS YOU HAVE THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP
WELL THERE ARE TEN WA THERE ARE TEN WINDS HERE IT ONLY PICKS UP THREE WASHERS
STRONGER
THE MAGNETIC FIELD CREATED BY THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY GETS STRONGER WITH THE MORE WRAPS YOU HAVE
FOR TEN WRAPS YOU WILL HAVE UM TEN WRAPS PICKS UP THREE WASHERS SO IF YOU KEEP ON WRAPPING IT AROUND TEN TIMES YOU YOU'LL GET A BUNCH OF WASHERS BUT IT GOES UP BY THREES SO IF YOU ADD TEN WASHER WINDS THERE'LL BE SIX WASHERS
BY RECORDING THE NUMBER OF WRAPS AND THE NUMBER OF WASHERS IT PICKS UP
WELL I LOOKED AT UM HOW THERE'S A FLAT LINE FOR EIGHTY WRAPS NINETY WRAPS AND A HUNDRED WRAPS AND I THOUGHT WELL NINETY FIVE IS BETWEEN NINETY AND A HUNDRED AND NINETY AND A HUNDRED PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
I THINK AGAIN THAT IT WOULD PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
WELL THERE'S A IRON OR STEEL CORE UM A WIRE THAT GOES AROUND THE CORE AND CONNECTS TO A BATTERY
I WOULD DISPLAY MY DA DATA UM
IT MEANS THE WIRE THE WIRE HAS GONE A HUNDRED TIMES AROUND THE CORE
WELL IT SHOWS THAT UM THE MORE WIRE WRAPS THERE ARE THE MORE WASHERS YOU CAN PICK UP ONLY SOMETIMES THE NUMBER OF WASHERS PICKED UP S CAN STAY THE SAME
THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU HAVE THERE ARE MORE WASHERS YOU CAN PICK UP
WELL YOU'VE WOUND THE WIRE AROUND THE CORE A HUNDRED TIMES AND IT'S ABLE TO PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
THE NUMBERS REPRESENT HOW MANY WIRE WRAPS YOU HAVE AND THE WORDS REPRESENT WIRE HOW MANY AND THE WORDS UM ARE TITLING THE NUMBERS AS THE NUMBERS UH THE NUMBER OF WIRE WRAPS YOU HAVE
ADD WRAPS
THE ELECTRICITY IS CREATING A STRONGER MAGNETIC FIELD
FIFTEEN
WELL YOU JUST WIND THE WIRE AROUND IT MORE TIMES
THE MORE WINDS YOU HAVE THE MORE WASHERS YOU CAN PICK UP BECAUSE THE STRONGER THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS
THE NUMBER OF WASHERS YOU PICK UP GOES UP
WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE WIRE CLIP BECAUSE THE SWITCH CLOSES THE CIRCUIT
GREAT HOW ARE Y HOW'S YOURSELF
IT CREATES A MAGNETIC FIEL
WHEN THE WHEN THE UH METAL PART OF THE SWITCH IS CONNECTING THE TWO WIRE CLIPS THE MAGNET THE WASHERS ARE ATTRACTED TO THE RIVET
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE SWITCH IS ON
THE SWITCH PE- PLAYS THE ROLE OF CIRCUIT BREAKER IN THIS ELECTROMAGNET
BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS THE COMPONENT THAT UH
AND MAGNETIC FIELD IS CREATED PICKING UP WASHERS
ELECTRICITY MUST BE IN A CIRCUIT OR FLOW IN A CIRCLE
WELL THE SWITCH HAS TO BE UM CONNECTING THE TWO WIRE CLIPS
THEY HAVE TO BE IRON OR STEEL
GOOD BYE
WELL IT MEANS THAT <BREATH> THEY AREN'T ALWAYS A MAGNET LIKE A PERMANENT MAGNET THEY'RE ONLY A MAGNET SOMETIMES
ELECTRICITY I CAN'T EXPLAIN VERY WELL
WELL THE ROLE OF A SWITCH IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THE SWITCH IS UM
WELL IF YOU HA WRAPPED THE CORE WITH WIRE A MAGNETIC FIELD IS CREATED <BREATH>
WELL THEY TELL YOU THAT WHEN THERE WHEN YOU MAKE A CIRCUIT OF ELECTRICITY THERE'S
YOU TWIST IT AROUND A CORE
IRON THE CORE HAS TO BE MADE OF IRO-
THE WIRES HAVE TO BE WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET <BREATH>
WELL IN AN ELECTROMAGNET THE SWITCH MUST BE ON IN ORDER FOR THE MAGNETIC FIELD TO BE CREATED IF IT'S OFF WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN RIPPED OFF
THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND CREATES A MAGNETIC FIELD ATTRACTING THE WASHERS TO THE IRON CORE
ELECTRICITY CREATES THE EMAG- THE MAGNETIC FIELD <BREATH> SO THAT THE WASHERS ARE ATTRACTED TO THE IRON CORE
WE'VE BEEN UH MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS
THEY ARE CONNECTED BY A WIRE A K A A PATHWAY
NO WAIT FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE WIRE TO THROUGH THE SWITCH THROUGH ANOTHER WIRE UM GOING AROUND THE RIVET AND BACK AGAIN <BREATH> THE RIVET IS CREATING A MAGNETIC FIELD SHOWN BY THE LIGHT BLUE TINT
YOU WERE SAYING THAT YOU WERE SAYING THAT THE CORE IS ALWAYS IRON
WELL WHEN THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO THE RIVET MAGNETIC FIELD IS CREATED AND THE WASHERS ARE EITHER IRON OR STEEL SO THEY ARE ATTRACTED TO THE CORE OF THE ELECTRO
IT'S COMPLETE
BECAUSE WHEN THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THERE'S A MAGNETIC FIELD
THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS RUNNING ALONG THE NAIL THEREFORE MAKING IT THE NAIL HAVE A MAGNETIC FIELD OF ITS OWN FOR A LITTLE BIT AND THEN IT CAN ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP FROM THERE
WELL THE MAGNET WILL NO THE PA THE NAIL WHEN IT TOUCHES THE PAPER CLIP IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING BUT WHEN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE PAPER CLIP THE MAGNETIC FIELD FLOWS THROUGH THE NAIL AND IS ABLE TO ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP
IRON AND STEEL UM CAN ATTRACT A MAGNET
I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF I CAN TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THAT
I DON'T REALLY I THAT'S BASICALLY ALL I KNOW ABOUT THIS SO I CAN'T REALLY HELP YOU
UM THERE ARE THESE LITTLE COMPARTMENTS INSIDE THE NAIL THAT UM WHEN THAT ARE USUALLY ALL AROUND THE PLACE AND WHEN I THEY'RE TOUCHING MAGNET THEY ALL ALIGN S AND THE NAIL IS TURNED INTO A MAGNET UM FOR A LITTLE BIT SO THAT'S WHY THE PAPER CLIP IS STICKING TO THE NAIL
THE NAIL MUST HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY TURNED INTO A MAGNET SO IT CAN ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP
THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING TO THE OPPOSITE MAGNETIC FORCE SO NORTH IS GOING TO SOUTH AND SOUTH IS GOING TO NORTH SO THEY DON'T WANNA STICK TOGETHER LIKE THAT
DON'T REALLY KNOW I'M STUMPED
IT'S PROBABLY NOT BE BEING ABLE TO UM ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP VERY WELL SO THE PAPER CLIP IS JUST FALLING OFF
ENOUGH SO I'M NOT SURE
WELL I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT NAILS TO ACTUALLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION <LAUGH>
THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS TRAVELING ALONG THE NAIL AND IS ABLE TO ATTRACT A PAPER CLIP WITH THE POWER OF THE MAGNET
I DON'T REALLY KNOW I DIDN'T OBSERVE THE THICK STACK
YOU HAVE TO UM GIVE THE NAIL A LITTLE MAGNETIC FIELD SO THAT IT CAN ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP
WELL THOSE LITTLE COMPARTMENTS THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT THEY ALIGN WHEN TOUCHING A MAGNET BUT USUALLY THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE S UM SO THE PAPER CLIP MUST BE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME WAY FOR IT TO BE A SLIGHTLY MAGNETIC OBJECT SO
MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND THE NAIL IS TEMPORARILY BECOMING A MAGNET ITSELF SO IT CAN ATTRACT THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP CAN UM CAN BE ATTRACTED BY A MAGNET
A HERBIVORE
CONSUMER OR HUMAN
HERBIVORES EAT ONLY PLANTS
BYE
THEY PRODUCE HEALTHY STUFF FOR PLANTS OR IS THAT EARTH WORMS
FOOD WEBS
TO EAT ONLY DEAD THINGS
A BERRY OR TYPE OF PLANT
ONLY EAT THEY EAT ONLY DECOMPOSED STUFF OR DEAD STUFF
WHEN THE CONSUMERS DIE THEY DECOMPOSE THEIR BODIES AND USE IT FOR OTHER STUFF NUTRIENTS
A HERBIVORE
THE BACTERIA AND THE MUSHROOMS ARE FUNGI
AN OMNIVORE
A BERRY
THE CONSUMERS ARE HUMANS BEARS LIONS AND POLAR BEARS THEY EAT MEAT THE HUMAN AND BEAR EAT MEAT AND BERRIES OR OTHER FOOD
BY EATING EACH OTHER OR THE PRODUCERS
THEY'RE A DECOMPOSER
IT'S A DECOMPOSER THEY'RE WORMS THEY EAT ONLY DEAD STUFF
THEY EAT PLANTS AND ONLY PLANTS
I THINK THE HERBIVORES EAT GRASS AND STUFF CARNIVORES EAT OTHER ANIMALS OMNIVORES EAT BOTH (()) EAT DECOMPOSED ANIMALS AND STUFF
THEY EAT THE PRODUCERS
A (()) A CARNIVORE
CARNIVORES AND OMNIVORES AND HERBIVORES
I DON'T KNOW
THE GRASS AND THE PINECONE
A OMNIVORE
THE DEAD BODIES AND TRESS AND STUFF OF DEAD ANIMALS AND PLANTS
THE PRODUCERS PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD CONSUMERS EAT THE PRODUCERS AND THEN DECOMPOSERS DECOMPOSE THE (()) THE CONSUMERS
THE HARE THE SNAKE THE HAWK AND THE BIRD THE BEETLE AND THE SALAMANDER
A DECOMPOSER
BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD
A MUSHROOM OR FUNGI
CARNIVORES EAT MEAT AND ONLY MEAT
TO ONLY EAT PLANTS THEY EAT BOTH PLANTS AND MEAT WAIT WHAT
GOOD I AM VERY GOOD
(()) PRODUCES ITS OWN FOOD
FUNGI OR MUSHROOMS
THEY FEED EACH OTHER WELL THE KILLED AND THEN THEY EAT THEM AND THEN SOME AND THEN THE BIOSPHERE DOES THAT AND BLAH BLAH
HAS ISLANDS OCEANS AND LIVING THINGS IT HAS BIOSPHERE ATMOSPHERE AND OTHER SMALLER SUBSYSTEMS
THEY ALL HAVE INTERACTING PARTS
THE INTERACTING PARTS
THE ECOSYSTEM IS PART OF ALL OF THE BIOSPHERE THE ECOSYSTEM IS PRETTY MUCH LIKE PRODUCERS DECOMPOSERS CONSUMERS SECOND CONSUMERS SO ON AND SO FORTH
IT'S YOUR BODY YOUR BODY'S A VERY BIG SYSTEM WITH SMALLER SYSTEMS INSIDE OF IT
THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CAR MOVE
WELL THEY ITS LIKE THEY LIKE THE RABBIT EATS THE GRASS AND THE SNAKE EATS THE RABBIT AND THEN THE SALAMANDER AND THEN THE SNAKE EATS THE SALAMANDER AND THEN THE SNAKE DIES AND GETS DECOMPOSED BY BACTERIA
IT HAS CREATURES THAT HAVE ADAPTED TO LIVE ON IT
IT USES ENERGY AND IT PRODUCES IT AND IT MOVES BECAUSE ALL THE PARTS
SMALLER SYSTEMS SUBSYSTEMS
A FOOD WEB
WELL ACTUALLY I'VE ALREADY PASSED IT
THE WAY THE ENERGY TRAVELS
LIVING THINGS
A LOT WAIT ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE I THINK
GOOD
WE HAVE UM INTERACTING PARTS AND SMALLER SYSTEMS INSIDE OF OUR BODY
THEY IT HAS A BIOSPHERE AND
THEY ALL HAVE INTERACTING PARTS
I'M DOING GOOD
I DO NOT KNOW I FORGOT
THE INTESTINES ABSORB ALL THE NUTRIENTS AND WATER FOR IT TO USE FOR OUR BODY
THEY'RE PART OF OUR SKIN
WE DID A YEAST EXPERIMENT
WE BOTH HAVE DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS
A BUTTERFLY IS MADE OUT OF CELLS
LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT
BRINGS FOOD DOWN TO THE STOMACH USING MUSCLES
I FORGOT LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT I DON'T I DON'T REMEMBER
BREAKING DOWN FOOD GIVING OUR BODIES ENERGY
THEY LOOK LIKE NERVES
THE FOOD DOWN TO THE STOMACH IT BRINGS THE FOOD DOWN TO THE STOMACH
THEY'RE VERY COOL THEY LOOK LIKE LONG STRIPS OF A MUSCLE AND THERE'S LITTLE DOTS IN BETWEEN
WE HAVE A LOT MORE CELLS THAN YEAST
BRAIN CELLS
THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
IT BREAKS DOWN FOOD
OKAY
HUMAN BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST ONE CELLED ORGANISMS LIKE YEAST
OUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
IT GIVES OUT WASTE WHICH IS DISGUSTING
THEY'RE MADE OF CELLS EVERYTHING'S MADE OUT OF CELLS EVERY LIVING THING'S MADE
THEY HELP US MOVE
STUFF
TO BREAK DOWN FOOD AND YEAH
LOOKS LIKE CELLS
THE MOUTH BREAKS DOWN THE FOOD
NORMAL CELLS BLOOD CELLS
LOOKS LIKE A FACTORY
THEY'RE SMALL THEY ALL ARE ONE CELL EACH LITTLE PIECE IS ONE CELL EACH LITTLE PIECE OF YEAST IS ONE CELL
THE PLANT ALSO NEEDS SUNLIGHT
YEAST ANIMAL CRACKERS WHICH HAVE SUGAR AND FLOUR AND WATER
THE ONE THAT IS DARKER THAT ONE'S BEEN IN A DARK BAG THE ONE THAT'S BRIGHTER HAS BEEN IN A LIGHT BAG THEN WE SWITCHED THEM AROUND AND I HAVEN'T KNOWN YET
MORE FOOD CHAINS AND FOOD WEBS BUT WE ALSO STUDIED OMNIVORES CARNIVORES AND HERBIVORES
VERY VERY MUCH SO
WELL THE A PLANT ALSO NEEDS AIR SO YEAH
PLANTS DON'T NEED HAMBURGERS BUT THEY NEED FOOD BUT THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD BY USING SUGAR SUNLIGHT AND WATER VAPOR
THAT IT NEEDS THREE SIMPLE NEEDS SUNLIGHT WATER AND I FORGOT THE THIRD ONE
ONE'S BEEN IN A DARK BAG THE OTHER HAS BEEN IN A LIGHT BAG ONE'S BEEN THE DARKER ONE HAS BEEN IN NO LIGHT WELL A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE'S BEEN IN THE LIGHT
DOES NOT NEED A HOME WELL KINDA DOES BUT NOT DOES NOT NEED TO BE INSIDE IT COULD BE OUTSIDE THEY'LL ACTUALLY DO IT MUCH BETTER CAUSE THE RAIN COULD WATER IT TOO
(()) FROM FOOD BUT I DID'T REALLY MENTION FOOD CAUSE IT PRODUCES IT'S OWN (())
ME LEAVING
VERY GOOD
I THINK IT'S ABOUT YEAST AND GETTING ITS NUTRIENTS
SUNLIGHT WATER AND THERE'S ONE MORE THING I CAN'T SUGAR I THINK
I THINK THE ANIMAL CRACKER HAD STUFF IN IT THAT GAVE NUTRIENTS TO THE YEAST SO NOW IT'S ALIVE
THE LEAF IS (())
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES FITTING THEIR THEIR SUIT WHATEVER PARALLEL THAT'S WHAT THE LEAF CALLED AND HAS PARALLEL VEINS
IT'S SHOWING THE WATER GOING UP TO A TO GET INTO THE LEAVES AND THE ORANGE IS GOING DOWN TO HELP THE ROOTS WHICH IS AND THE ORANGE IS SUNLIGHT AND THE BLUE IS WATER
THAT'S A BAG AROUND A LEAVE THAT SHOWS WATER VAPOR COMING OFF OF THE LEAF WHICH IS VERY USEFUL
THE ZIGGY ZAGGY ARROWS ARE LIGHT THE RED ARROWS ARE CARBON DIOXIDE GOING OFF THE BLUE ARROW IS IS WATER THE BIG BLUE ARROW IS IS WATER VAPOR GOING INTO IT THE BLUE SMALL BLUE ARROWS ARE WATER GOING FROM THE GROUND THROUGH EVERYWHERE THE ORANGE ARROWS IS LIGHT THAT COME THAT CAME INTO PRODUCE HAPPEN TO THE ROOTS THE RED ARROWS DOWN THERE ARE ALL CARBON DIOXIDE COMING INTO THE PLANT
IT'S A PALMATE
I DON'T KNOW I FORGOT I HAVE A SHORT TERM MEMORY SOMETIMES
GETTING FOOD FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND MAKING FOOD
A PALMATE
IT'S A PALERMITE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I KNOW IT STARTS WITH A P I THINK

OXYGEN UHM FOOD WELL NUTRIENTS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER ONE
THEY'RE WELL PRETTY MUCH THE THE VEIN'S DELIVERY SYSTEM THE HEART'S DELIVERY SYSTEM THEN THE VEINS ARE THE ROADS
THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
AIR GOING IN AND OUT OF THE LUNGS AND EVERYTHING WORKING
GRAMS THE UHM
BLOOD'S GOING IN AND OUT
DIAPHRAGM
THAT THE HEART LIKE ONE SIDE OF THE HEART PUMPS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE BODY THE OTHER SIDE JUST PUMPS TO THE LUNGS AND BACK
UHM THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
THEY'RE TUBES THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF INTO THE TRACHEA AND GO DEEP INTO THE LUNGS AND THEY PRETTY MUCH HOLD THE AIR SACK
UHM (()) LIKE THE THREE MAIN PARTS
OKAY
H THE AIR SACKS OR ALVEOLI
ALL THE SYSTEMS
BLUE ARE CELLS
PRETTY MUCH THE HIGHWAYS FOR BLOOD AND THEY'RE CALLED VEINS AND ARTERY
THEY BOTH HAVE HEARTS AND VEINS
T THE TRACHEA
UHM THE PUMP
UHM TO GET THE CARBON DIOXIDE OUT OF YOUR BODY AND GET THE UHM UHM OXYGEN INTO YOUR BODY SO YOUR BODY CAN MOVE AND STUFF
C UHM DOES WELL HOLDS THE BLOOD
GETTING OXYGEN TO YOUR CELLS AND GETTING CARBON DIOXIDE OUT
CELLS ARE DROPPING OFF CARBON DIOXIDE AND PICKING UP OXYGEN
FROM A AND B
IT TAKES AND IT FILTERS THE AIR THAT WILL GO INTO THE LUNGS
UHM THE SAME THING
UHM PRETTY MUCH THE BLOOD PUMPS UH THE HEART PUMPS BLOOD THROUGH THE VEINS THE VEINS DELIVER NUTRIENTS AND OXYGEN WATER TO THE CELLS AND THEN THE ARTERIES BRING IT BACK TO THE HEART TO GET PUMPED OUT AGAIN
THE PARTS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
IT'S A SHEET OF MUSCLE THAT SITS UNDER THE LUNGS WHEN THE DIAGRAM CONTRACTS THE LUNGS DRAW AIR IN AND THE DIAPHRAGM WHEN IT RELAXES THE LUNGS EXPEL AIR OUT THE END
GIVE BLOOD TO THE HEART AND TAKE IT AWAY
GOOD
PUMPS BLOOD
THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING OXYGEN INTO YOUR BODY AND CARBON DIOXIDE OUT
IT'S THE IT'S THE LUNGS THAT PRETTY MUCH MEANS THAT IT'S THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM AND YEAH
IT HAS THREE MAIN PARTS

BECAUSE MAYBE ONE HAS MORE SALT THAN THE OTHER OR IT MIGHT HAVE MORE WATER
THAT IT WOULD TAKE THAT IT WOULD SALT CAN MAKE SOMETHING FLOAT
BYE BYE
THEY WILL SINK OR THEY WILL MIX
THERE'S MORE SALT
THEY ARE SEPARATING SO THE DENSER ONE WILL STAY ON THE BOTTOM AND THEN THE LIGHTER ONE WILL THE LESS DENSE ONE WILL STAY ON THE TOP
IT WOULD BE MORE DENSE BECAUSE THEN THINGS WOULD FLOAT
IT'S HEAVIER BECAUSE IT IT SINKS
WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT WATERS AND DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS
IT'S VERY CONCENTRATED
IT'S GOING TO FLOAT

THAT THE LIMESTONE AFTER ACID RAIN AFTER A YEAR STILL HAD
IT IS GOING INTO THE IT'S GOING INTO THE SKY OR
THE SAME THING HAPPENED
IT'S A SOLUTION
CAN WE PLEASE GO ON
WELL WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS UM (()) SOLUTIONS UNIT AND WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTES AND SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
THAT THEY WILL GET HEAVIER IF YOU MIX IT WITH A BIGGER NUMBER
THAT WITHOUT A SOLVENT OR A SOLUTE IT WOULD NOT MAKE A SOLUTION OR
THE SALT IS DISSOLVING BECAUSE SOME
I DON'T KNOW
THE WATER TO EVAPORATE OR A HOT DRY CLIMATE OR FOR SUN TO HIT IT
THAT IT ALL MIXES TOGETHER A BIGGER FORM OF A SOLUTION
YEAH
WE HAVE LEARNED THAT A SOLUTION IS NOT ALWAYS A MIXTURE BUT A MIXTURE IS NOT ALWAYS A SOLUTIONS
SOLUTIONS
WELL IT'S PLAYING A ROLE BECAUSE WITHOUT THE WATER IT WOULD JUST BE POWDER AND IF YOU JUST HAD THE WATER THERE WOULD BE NO SOLUTION
THAT FIFTY THAT WITHOUT ONE OF THEM IT WOULD NOT MAKE THE OTHER SO WAIT
A SOLVENT
THAT IS A MIXTURE BECAUSE IT CAN BE FILTERED OUT
TIME
IT'S EVAPORATION AND IT HELPS IT EVAPORATE
IT'S A MIXTURE
MIXTURE
WELL YOU'RE ADDING WATER TO SALT IN THE BOTTOM ONE AND THEN IT LOOKS LIKE IT DISSOLVES AND THEN ON THE TOP ONE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ADDED WATER WITH SAND OR POWDER AND THEY TURNED THE WATER BROWNISH
WELL SALT CAN DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER IT WILL JUST GO INTO THE WATER IT WON'T BECAUSE IT WON'T GO AWAY BECAUSE IF YOU TRY AND EVAPORATE THE WATER IT WILL JUST COME BACK WHEN THE WATER GOES AWAY
WELL A SALT CAN'T DISSOLVE WELL THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE BUT THEN THE SAND WILL UM WILL NOT DISSOLVE BECAUSE IT IS A SOLID
A SOLUTION
I DON'T KNOW
WHEN YOU MIX THEM THEY BECOME A BIGGER MASS BECAUSE TWO SOLUTES HAVE MIXED
GOOD I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT
A SOLUTE
THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED BECAUSE IT CAN BE DISSOLVED IT WAS A SOLID AND IS A LIQUID BUT THEN SO THEN IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN SEE HOW IT CHANGED
I DON'T
THAT EACH MASS IS THE SAME
<NO_SIGNAL>
A MIXTURE
THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER WAIT YEAH THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER BECAUSE WITHOUT THE WATER YOU'D JUST BE POURING SALT INTO A CUP AND THEN IT HELPS IT BECAUSE YOU WOULD HELP IT WITH HELPING THE SALT WITH THE WATER
BECAUSE IT'S EVAPORATION
I DON'T KNOW WAIT IS IT A SOLUTION
THAT WHEN YOU PUT EACH FIFTY GRAM OF WATER WILL
YES
I DON'T KNOW
THE FLOUR MAKES THE WATER GO MORE
YES YES YOU CAN
THE SALT DISSOLVES BUT THEN WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE COFFEE FILTER IT COMES BACK AND THE SALT WILL STAY
GOOD
SOLUTION
IT IS IT'S THE SALT CRYSTALS BECAUSE THE WATER HAS GONE OUT AND THEN THE SALT CRYSTALS ARE LEFT BECAUSE THE WATER IT DOES IT NEVER GOES AWAY
YOU CAN'T
UM SOLUTION THREE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTION ONE BECAUSE IT WEIGHS MORE
THREE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
NOTHING
THE WEIGHT
BLAH BLAH BLAH OKAY UM WE'VE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS A LOT
YES
IT WOULD MAKE IT HEAVIER
TWO
I WAS RIGHT
HORRIBLE
BECAUSE ONE HAS DIFFERENT MASS AND IT'S HEAVIER
ONE WILL BE HEAVIER THAN ANOTHER
SOLUTION ONE AND SOLUTION TWO
ONES AT TASTER AND ONES UH OBSERVED
THERE ALL OF EM ARE DIFFERENT
WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER ON A SCALE

HELLO ANYBODY THERE ANYBODY COME IN COME IN OVER
THEY'RE THE SAME CAUSE THEY'RE MADE UP OF THE SAME THING
THAT WAS MY FRIEND HE'S SO SMART
COOL
IT'S THERE'S HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
WELL FIRST OF ALL YOU SHOOK IT UP SO THEN IT'S GONNA MIX TOGETHER AND THEN IT'S GONNA SETTLE AND IT'S GONNA TURN DIFFERENT
THEY'RE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES SO THEY WILL BE DIFFERENT AND ALSO THAT UM THAT PEOPLE WILL FARMERS WILL BE LIKE FARMERS HAVE DIFFERENT THINGS THAN MOUNTAINS BECAUSE DESERTS HAVE DON'T HAVE DELTAS

I'M OKAY HELLO (()) HELLO
I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T SEE THEM
THEY'RE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES

WELL WE BEEN DOING VINEGAR EVAPORATING DISHES WHERE WE PUT ROCKS AND VINEGAR AND SEEING WHAT CHEMICAL WEATHERING IS
WIND WATER YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
IT HELPS UM TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN FREEZING CAUSE A HUGE BOULDER CAUSE OF A LITTLE CRACK AND THEN A WHOLE BOULDER COULD CRUSH
IT FELL OFF AND THEN IT FELL OFF THE CLIFF BROKE INTO THEN HIT A COUPLE ROCKS AND THEN SPLASHED INTO THE WATER
THE BOULDERS ARE THE BIGGEST THE
ONCE IT FELL INTO THE WATER IT HIT MAYBE ANOTHER STONE AND THEN IT STARTED WEATHERING BY THE WATER
RIGHT
HELLO ANY BODY THERE HELLO HELLO
BECAUSE UM IT COULDN'T GET THE TOP OFF AND THEN UM IT HAD NO WHERE TO GO BUT OUT COULD BECAUSE ICE EXPANDS WHEN IT DOES IT COULD JUST GO IT COULD JUST BREAK ANYTHING AT ONCE
<NO_SIGNAL>
<NO_SIGNAL>
ONCE IT ONCE IT FILLS UP AND FREEZES IT EXPANDS AND THAT CAUSES IT TO BREAK AND THEN ONCE IT FREEZES IT ONCE IT FALLS APART AND THEN IT ALL BREAKS OFF ABRASION ABRASION HEY HEY
GOOD
THE BIGGER PIECES OF ROCK DON'T HAVE MUCH UM MUCH THINGS TO CRASH INTO THEM FOR THEM TO ERODE SO THEY'RE GONNA STAY THE BIGGEST BUT THEN THE
THEY WERE IN THE RIVER A TON AND THEN THEY GOT WASHED DOWN AND HIT WITH OTHER ROCKS AND THEN JUST GOT ERODED UNTIL
WATER HAD GOTTEN INTO THE CRACKS INTO THAT ROCK IF IT HAD ANY CRACKS OR IF IT HAD THIS ONE TINY CRACK IT COULD'VE GOTTEN INTO THAT CRACK FROZEN AND THEN IT COULD OF BROKEN UP MORE
DELTA GRAVEL
IT DIDN'T IT COULDN'T
TREE ROOTS
FIRST THEY WERE
WIND KNOCKED THE BOULDER OFF THE CLIFF AND IT BROKE (()) AND THEN IT FELL INTO THE WATER AND BROKE AND ERODED
IT EXPANDS
BECAUSE THE DELTA GRAVEL HAS BEEN THERE WAY MORE THAN THE BOULDER HAVE SO THEY HAVE BEEN JUST GETTING HAMMERED WITH OTHER ROCKS AND GETTING PUSHED DOWNSTREAM
SAY WHAT
EPSOM SALT
I SAID A
WE'VE BEEN USING THESE MATERIALS
IT'S SALT
I'VE BEEN SEEING THE WATER'S GETTING HIGHER AND THE SALT IS SATURATING THE WATER AND THEN AFTER THE FILTER IT'S LEAVING IT'S LEAVING STUFF IT'S LEAVING SALT BEHIND THAT

THAT WHEN THEY WERE MIXED TOGETHER THEY EITHER BLEW UP THE BAG AND FIZZED
REPEAT
THERE'S GAS LIQUID AND SOLID
GOOD
THE UM ONCE THE THE UM LIQUID IS ADDED TO THE THE WATER WELL THE SOLUTION WELL POWDER IT WILL IT WILL IS FIZZING
REPEAT THAT
THERE'S A CHEMICAL REACTION ON SCALE AND ONE IS HEAVIER THE THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND ONE IS HAS MORE SOLID
REPEAT
GAS LIQUID AND SOLID
IF A PRODUCT IS LEFT
THAT SCIENCE IS WEIRD
THE FIRST CAN HAS UM SOLUTE AND THEN THE SECOND HAS NONE AT ALL
UM CALCIUM CHLORIDE WATER AND UM SOMETHING ELSE
IT'S SALT
IF IT WOULD FIZZ OR IF IT TURNED HOT OR COLD
WE HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT
THERE WAS A BAG AND THEN UM THERE WAS TWO THERE WAS TWO SOLUTES AND THEN UM YOU PUT THE WATER IN THERE AND UM THE BAG FIZZED AND WENT DOWN
YEAH
ONE WITH THE BAG CLOSED IS WEIGHS MORE THAN THE ONE WITH THE BAG OPEN CAUSE IT HAS AIR INSIDE IT TRAPPED INSIDE OF IT

I WAS SO RIGHT
ME SO WAS RIGHT
UH DON'T
CAUSE THERE'S A MAGNETIC FORCE INSIDE THE MIXTURE
BECAUSE THERE'S MAGNETIC PROPERTIES IN THE METAL OF THE SAFETY CLIPS
THAT GRAVEL TOO BIG IN THROUGH A
NO MAAM
THAT SINCE THE TOOTH PINS THAT THEY THAT THE SAFETY PINS ARE MAGNETIC THEY GET PICKED UP BY THE MAGNET
A SCREEN
THE SAFETY PINS ARE MAGNETIC THE OTHERS ARE NOT
IF THE WATER'S GETTING FILTERED THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE GRAVEL CAN NOT GO THROUGH THE SCREEN
YEAH

THERE ARE THINGS THAT IF YOU PUT MULTIPLE THINGS TOGETHER AND THEY HAVE THE SAME PROPERTIES THEY (())
SORRY OKAY UH THE SAFETY CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC AND THERE THE ONLY METAL IN THOSE

I THINK THERE IS CAUSE IT'S TURNING THE WATER'S TURNING PURPLE
(())
THERE ARE HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN ATOMS IN THE VINEGAR
YEAH IF YOU UH
WHEN YOU BROKE THE GLOW WHEN YOU LIKE LIKE PUT LIKE THE SNAPPED THE GLOW STICK THE FLUID INSIDE OF IT MIXED TOGETHER AND IT MADE A CHEMICAL REACTION SO IT GLOWED
IT'S FIZZING FIZZING FIZZING AND THERE'S A CLOCK
IT FIZZED AND THEN IT WENT DOWN AND NOW IT'S CLEAR
I IT DOESN'T LOOK (()) BUT I THINK I I THINK THERE WAS
IT GETS PURPLE OH MY GOSH THAT'S SO
IT SHOWS THAT IT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION AND IT'S IMPORTANT CAUSE CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE (())
THE THE SODIUM HYDROXIDE AND THE HYDROXIDE ACID MADE SOME OF THE ATOMS INSIDE THE WATER PURPLE
THE ATOMS MUST BE DIFFERENT
MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
IT STARTED FIZZING SO AND WHEN IT'S FIZZING LIKE THAT IT SHOWS THAT A CHEMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE
UH RIGHT NOW OKAY BEFORE THEY ALL THE ATOMS WERE BLUE AND THEY HAD MICKE MOUSE EARS WHICH MEANS THEY'RE WATER ATOMS AND THE SODIUM HYDROXIDE AND THE HYDRAULIC ACID MAKE TWO OF THE BLUE ATOMS PURPLE AND ONLY HAD ONE SMALL (())
THE WATER OR THE SUBSTANCE IS POURED INTO THE MIDDLE ONE MADE IT TURN PURPLE
IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF A CHEMICAL REACTION CAUSE THE WATER TURNED BLUE AND CLEAR
THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION GOING BECAUSE THE BIKE HAD RUST ON IT AT THE END OF THE YEAR
THEY ARE DIFFERENT COLORS AND IN DIFFERENT SHAPES WHICH MEANS THERE ARE DIFFERENT MOLECULES AND DIFFERENT TYPES
PARTICIPATE IS THAT WHAT IT'S CALLED
<NO_SIGNAL>
I FORGOT MARNI
A SOLVENT
UH CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
<NO_SIGNAL>
I SEE IN THE VINEGAR I SEE OXYGEN AND
A CHEMICAL REACTION
IT'S FIZZING FOR A LONG LONG LONG TIME
A CHEMICAL REACTION OCCURRED BECAUSE THE WATER TURNED GREEN WITH THE DRIP OF GREEN BLUE
IT TURNED GREY
(())
REACTANT
REACTANT
TWO OF THE ATOMS ARE BLUE TWO OF THE ATOMS ARE BLUE
A CHEMICAL REACTION
CHEMICAL REACTION JUST BECAUSE THE WATER WENT UP THE ICE CUBES LIKE JUST MADE THE WATER GO UP THERE WAS NOTHING HAPPENING EXCEPT THE WATER GOING
WHAT I
SHUT UP AND REPEAT THAT PETER SHUT UP
CALCIUM CHLORIDE BAKING SODA AND WATER
BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
YOU'RE POURING THE VINEGAR AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY BAKING SODA INTO A WATER AND THEN IT'S FIZZ
IT'S GOING THROUGH THE SEASONS AND IT'S GETTING RUSTY RUSTY AND MORE AND MORE RUSTY AND NOW THE CALENDARS EMPTY (()) ANOTHER BIKES (()) RUSTY
A CHEMICAL REACTION
IT TURNED IT HAD A CHEMICAL REACTION AND SO IT TURNED
(()) IT JUST TURNED GREEN THAT WAS GREY
UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE LEARNING
THE (()) OKAY IT'S GETTING REALLY LIKE THE WATER GOT SATURATED AND IT WAS FULL AND COMPLETELY FULL OF SALT AND IT CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE SALT WHEN IT AND SO IT THE SALT STARTS GOING ON THE IN THE BOTTOM AND THAT'S CALLED SATURATED SATURATED WHATEVER I DON'T CARE
MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
YOU MINUS SIXTY SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN MINUS FIFTY EQUALS SEVENTEEN AND WE ALL LEARNED THAT IN KINDERGARTEN
THEY'RE DOING THE EXACT SAME THING BUT JUST WITH SUGAR
IT'S SATURATED IT CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE THE WATER'S SATURATED IT CAN'T HOLD ANY MORE SALT IN IT CAUSE IT (())
I HATE SCIENCE AND SCIENCE SUCKS
WHAT REPEAT REPEAT
IT'S GETTING LIKE IT CAN'T HOLD THE SUGAR ANY LONGER
IT'S GETTING THE SOLID IS GETTING POURED INTO IT AND THERE'S STILL SOME SALT ON THE BOTTOM AND I CALL THAT SATURATED
THE MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
IT'S WATER WITH SALT INSIDE OF IT OMG
YOU'RE THEY'RE MEASURING IT'S MEASURING HOW MUCH GRAMS ARE IN THE SALT IT'S MEASURING HOW MUCH LIKE GRAMS ARE IN A SOLUTION IT'S MEASURING HOW MANY GRAMS
ORANGE
(()) MIND WELL IT'S SIXTY SEVEN MINUS SIXTY SEVEN MINUS FIFTY GRAMS WHICH EQUALS SEVENTEEN GRAMS WE ALL LEARNED THAT IN KINDERGARTEN RIGHT HOPEFULLY
THERE'S STILL SOME SALT LEFT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE JAR
(()) INGREDIENTS TWO INGREDIENTS THAT ONE DISSOLVES OR DISAPPEARS INTO THE OTHER ONE
(())
THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER THAN THE WATER EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT
IT'S SATURATED IT'S SATURATED SATURATED SATURATED SATURATED
WE MEASURED THE SALT SOLUTION AND THEN WE MISUSED IT BY FIFTY CAUSE WE NEED FIFTY GRAMS OF WATER
UH SOMEONE YAWNED I (()) YOU
SCIENCE SUCKS AND I HATE IT SO I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT
IT'S GETTING IT'S GETTING IT'S GETTING IT'S GETTING VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY THERE'S THERE'S PUTTING EPSOM SALT INTO THE WATER AND THEY'RE MIXING THE WATER AND THE WATER'S GETTING MORE AND MORE SATURATED BECAUSE IT CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE WATER IN IT
THE THIRD ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE SECOND
LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
I THINK THE SECOND ONE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
(())
THE DENSITY AND THE DARKENSS AND THE LIGHTNESS OF EACH
MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS ONE'S A SALT WATER SOLUTION AND ONE'S A GRAPE SOLUTION
THE ONES TO THE RIGHT ARE GETTING DENSER
OKAY AM I SUPPOSED TO TALK YEAH OKAY HEY CAN YOU REPEAT THAT CAUSE OH I THINK UH I THINK B IS THE MOST (()) AND C IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
ONE HAS ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ONE HAS TWENTY
THE TWENTY GRAM SOLUTE WILL WEIGH MORE THAN THE TEN GRAM SOLUTE
YES SIR UM REPEAT PLEASE (())
(()) CADE CADE CADE LOOK AT THIS CADE BLAH OH (()) JADE THAT WAS MEAN BYE WAS NICE TO SEE YOU I'M TRYING TO GET IT TO THE HIGHEST POINT IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU YEP IT WAS NO IT REALLY WASN'T BUT BYE BYE LOOK AT SEXY BODY TOMORROW (())
SHUT UP I'M TRYING TO LEARN UH I WAIT SORRY WHAT'S THAT (()) REPEAT
(()) WAS NOT FUNNY MARNI WILL YOU PLEASE
NOTHING
I THINK THE FIRST IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE SECOND (()) AND THE THIRD IS IN THE MIDDLE
YES SIR
THE SECOND IS THE MOST DILUTED OR THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
(())
CAN YOU REPEAT
BYE
A SOLUTION
THE SAND AFTER BEING MIXED DISAPPEARED
SOLUTIONS ONE DISAPPEARS IN THE MIXTURE I MEAN IN A A SOLUTION IT IT DISAPPEARS AND IN A MIXTURE BOTH THE PROPERTIES STAY THE SAME
<NOISE>
THE SALT DISAPPEARED AFTER BEING MIXED AND THE SAND DIDN'T
THE SOLVENT IN THIS PICTURE IS SALT AND THE REASON THE ROLE THE ROLE IT PLAYS INSIDE THE SOLUTION IS IT'S THE PART THAT DISAPPEARS
IS (()) NAKED RIGHT NOW SHUT UP (()) SHE'S LYING SO MUCH WITH ME IT IT DOES SALT AND OVER TIME IT'S TURNING IN CRYSTALS AND REFORMING
THE CITRIC DISAPPEARED INTO THE WATER
MIXTURE
THE SALT DISAPPEARED AND NOW IT'S GOING INTO THE FILTER
A SOLUTION
REPEAT
THE ONE THE THING ON THE LEFT (()) IS SEPARATED AND THE EQUAL AND THE RIGHT SIDE IS ALL MIXED TOGETHER AND IT WEIGHS WHAT ALL OF THEM
THE SOLUTE IS THE SALT AND IT DISAPPEARS AFTER BEING MIXED WITH THE WATER
A MIXTURE
(()) (()) MARNEY
I'M LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
A SOLUTION
EVEN THOUGH THE SALT DISAPPEARS IT IS STILL INSIDE THE WATER
THE SALT'S GETTING IN THE (())
GOOD HATE YOUR FACE WHY ARE YOU SO UGLY
WHAT DOES THE FOX SAY
SHE'S REALLY CREEPY
SOLUTIONS
WHAT IS YOUR NAME
DO YOU THINK (()) ANNOYING
CAUSE IT'S A SOLUTION AND SCIENCE IS COOL AND
<NOISE> (()) SALT AND CAN YOU
THE REPEAT CAUSE THEY'RE BEING
CAN YOU CAN YOU REPEAT
A SOLUTION I THINK (()) (()) HE'S RIGHT OVER THERE RIGHT
THE WATER AND AND THE GRAMS ARE GETTING MEASURED TO SEE HOW MANY GRAMS THE WATER WEIGH
IT GOES INSIDE THE MOLECULES OF THE WATER
IT IS GETTING BIGGER AND HEAVIER
DON'T KNOW
IT GETS (()) OKAY
IN A MIXTURE YES IN A SOLUTION NO
I DON'T KNOW
<SILENCE>
<NOISE>
THE
THE SOLVENT
THE THE THE PUT POURED FLOUR INTO THE WATER AND THEN THEY ARE USING A FILTER TO SEPARATE THE FLOUR FROM THE WATER
(()) ON THE LEFT SIDE I SEE LIKE A (()) LOOKING STUFF IN THE MIDDLE
GOT THAT MOVES LIKE JAGGER DA (()) I'M A FREAKING MONKEY (()) LIKE (()) ONE IS GETTING MORE SATURATED FASTER THAN (())
WE HAD A WE HAD A SOLUBILITY CHART THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT (()) TO LIKE SO YOU CAN FIGURE OUT LIKE WHICH ONE WAS WHICH
(())
(())
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW CAUSE I'M NOT VERY SMART AND I'M ONLY IN KINDERGARTEN
(())
(()) OKAY (())
REPEAT CAUSE MY FRIEND CADE IS BEING RETARDED AND MY NAME IS ROBERT BURNS AND I'M LIKE A LEADER OF (()) AND I WANT TO TEACH YOU TO BE A GOOD GOOD (())
EATING FISH AND BEGINS HE'S GOT IT I SEE IT
YEAH IT DOES LET'S SAY SOMETHING
BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MOLECULES AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MASS
(())
CITRIC ACID
<NO_SIGNAL>
THEY ARE A MIX
UM THE SCREEN THE SCREEN (()) THE MARBLES AWAY FROM THE WATER AND THE WATER AWAY FROM THE MARBLE
(())
THE THE UH SALT MIXTURE IT DISAPPEARED WELL AND DISSOLVED WHILE THE OTHER TWO MIXTURES THE CONTENTS INSIDE OF IT HAD THE SAME PROPERTY
THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE THE
IT'S LIKE IT DISAPPEARED AND DISSOLVED
CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT YOU
THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER AND THIS TYPE OF MIXTURE IS CALLED A SOLUTION
WHAT GENDER ARE YOU
IT LIKE WHEN YOU PULLED THEM WE PULLED ALL THE MIXTURES APART BY USING DIFFERENT
UM YOU WE CALL IT A SOLUTION
NO THAT CAN YOU REPEAT MY SENTENCE I HATE (())
OKAY UM IT'S BEEN TAKEN APART AND WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT IS IT'S NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
WE CALL THEM MIXTURES AND MIXTURES ARE IMPORTANT AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
THE SALT IT LIKE DISAPPEARS AND GOES INTO THE MOLECULES OF THE WATER
IT'S BEEN TAKEN APART
THEY ALL ARE MIXTURES
SOME ARE ROUND AND SOME ARE HAVE ARE SKINNY AND SOME ARE KIND OF
HI
THE TRAIL MIX HAS BEEN PULLED APART FROM BEING A
THE MARBLES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE WATER BY USING A FILTER
A MIXTURE
I SEE A NUTS I SEE PAPER CLIPS I SEE MARBLES AND I SEE A
THE MARBLES UH AFTER GETTING LIKE FROM THE WATER THEY'RE KIND OF DRYING OFF AND THE WATER IS NOT TOUCHING THE MARBLES ANYMORE
SALAD IS A MIXTURE OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THE THE NUTS ARE A MIXTURE AND THE MARBLES ARE MIXTURES THE WATERS
NO I DID
BYE BYE A CAN YOU REPEATS MY SENTENCE (())
I'M GOOD
THAT IS LIKE WHEN YOU IF YOU CONNECT LIKE WHEN YOU CONNECT A LIGHTBULB IT LIKE IT'S LIKE CONNECTING A MOTOR TO THE BATTERY AND THE OTHER WIRE THE OTHER WIRE TO THE OTHER CLIP OF THE BATTERY AND YOU CONNECT IT TO BOTH OF IF YOU PUT BOTH OF THE WIRES TOGETHER INSTEAD OF JUST PUTTING IT ON THE CLIP IT'LL J
C OR A B OR C D
WELL TODAY WE GOT UM <BREATH> A LIGHTBULB CARRIER AND THERE WERE TWO CLIPS NEXT TO IT WE HAD TO PUT ONE SMALL WIRE FROM THE BATTERY'S CLIP TO THE LIGHTBULB'S CARRIER CLIP AND WE GOT THREE WIRES SO WE GOT THE ANOTHER THE OTHER ONE WE HAD TO PUT IT IN THE OTHER CLIP THAT'S THAT WAS NEXT TO THE LIGHTBULB AND THE THIRD ONE WE HAD TO PUT IT IN THE BATTERIES THE BAT N A CLIP NEXT TO THE BATTERY AND WE HAD TO CONNECT IT TO THIS UM CLIPS AND SEE IF IF THE LIGHTBULB LIT
UM YES WELL CIRCUIT LIKE YOU HAVE TO PUT FIRST LIKE YOU HAVE TO PUT THE BATTERY IN THE BATTERY'S PLACE AND THEN YOU PUT UM THE LIGHTBULB CARRIER IN THE RIGHT UM WHERE IT SHOULD GO BECAUSE THEN AFTER YOU DID THAT THEN WE THEN YOU LIKE CONNECT THE WIRES YOU USUALLY GET THREE WIRES BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PUT BOTH OF THOSE IN ONE LIKE YOU ONE OF THOSE NAILS LIKE <BREATH> A SOMETHING AND THEN YOU
WELL WE WE WERE TRYING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ELEC- ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY AND THEN UH WE SO FIRST AND THEN WE GOT THIS THIS BOARD THAT HAD CLIPS AND INSIDE THERE WAS A WIRE CONNECTED TO THOSE CLIPS LIKE I TOLD YOU AND YOU HAD TO YOU GOT TWO WIRES EXTRA AND YOU HAD TO PUT IN TH IN THOSE CLIPS AND MAKE THE LIGHTBULB LIGHT AND THE CLIPS WERE THE CLIPS HAD LIKE LETTERS IT SAYS A B C D AND IT COULD MMM THE MATCHES SOMETIMES COULD BE A AND D B
WELL FIRST WE CAN PUT THE BATTERY IN WHERE THE BATTERY GOES AND THEN WE CAN GET THE WIRE AND CONNECT IT TO THE BATTERY'S CLIP AND THEN WE PUT THE LIGHTBULB CARRIER WHERE THE LIGHTBULB CARRIER GOES AND THEN WE CAN CONNECT THE WIRES
WELL YOU HAVE TO COMPLETE LIKE YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT INTO A CIR- IT IT'S LIKE YOU PUT THE BATTERY IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND THE LIGHTBULB IN THE RIGHT PLACE FIRST WHEN I DID THIS I HAD TROUBLE BECAUSE I I COULDN'T LIGHT UP THE LIGHTBULB OUR LIGHTBULB WAS LOOSE SO I HAD TO PRESS ON IT SO IT WAS KIND OF HARD AT FIRST THEN AFTER WE GOT THE HANG OF IT AFTER I GOT THE HANG OF IT LIKE I F FIG FOUND OUT WHERE THE WIRES WERE BENEATH THE CARDBOARD
WORK BECAUSE YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE SENDING OUT THE ENERGY TO THE MOTOR INSTEAD OF GETTING IT FROM THE CLIP BECAUSE THERE WAS A WIRE UNDERNEATH THE CARD <BREATH> BOARD BETWEEN IT SO WH- THE LIGHTBULB LIKE LIT WHEN YOU TOUCHED WHEN YOU GOT A AND B IF YOU DID THAT IF THAT THOSE TWO WERE TWO RIGHT ONES THEN IT LIT BECAUSE THERE WAS A WIRE UNDER IT
WELL I FOUND OUT THAT UM THE WELL ONE THING WAS CONFUSING BECAUSE ONE TIME WHEN I PUT BOTH OF THE WIRES IN THE SAME PLACE IT LIT BUT IT WASN'T THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE IT WASN'T THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE YOU ARE PUTTING IT IN THE SAME SO ELE- ELEC- THE ELEC- THE ELECTRICITY IS MOVING S SA THROUGH THE SAME CLIP AND AND THEY BOTH GET THE SAME SO IT'S LIKE THE SAME THING CONNECTING TWO WIRES SAME
YOU HAD TO PUT IN LIKE
WE HAVE A BATTERY WIRE AND A LIGHTBULB WITH THE LIGHTBULB KIT
AND A AND B AND AFTER YOU WERE DONE WITH THAT WE HA WE AT LEAST HAD TO DO TWO WE GOT TO SWITCH AROUND WITH PEOPLE
WELL SINCE I CLICKED ON THE BATTERY IT'S GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY IF I CLICK ON THE BATTERY AGAIN IT'S GOING TO GO A DIFFERENT WAY
YOUR WELCOME
IT STARTS ON THE BATTERY AND IT GOES O ALL AROUND THE WIRES TO THE LIGHTBULB AND IT COMES BACK AND IT AND IT GOES THROUGH TH THE SAME WAY AGAIN EVERY TIME
FROM THE MINUS
WELL THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHTBULB SO THE LIGHTBULB IS LIGHTING UP
OK
WELL THE BATTERY IS ABOUT IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE BATTERY YOU COULDN'T GET THE ENERGY TO UM LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB AND IT WOULDN'T WORK
UH YEAH WELL THE ELEC- WELL THE BATTERY'S GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHTBULB WHERE IT'S IN THE IN THE METAL AND IT'S GOING THROUGH AND DOWN THE LIGHTBULB BACK TO THE BATTERY AND IT'S GOING BACK TO THE LIGHTBULB
WELL ONE PART OF THE WIRE IS IN THE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHTBULB AND IT'S CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND THE OTHER WIRE IS CONNECTED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND IT'S CONNECTED TO THE LIGHTBULB TO METAL
BECAU- IF IF YOU DIDN'T PUT IT IN THE METAL LIKE WHERE THE ME METAL WAS IT THE IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP
WELL FIRST WHEN IT STARTS IT'S GOING THE SAME WAY THEN IT TURNS AND THEN IT GOES DIFFERENT AND THEN <BREATH> FI FIRST LIKE FIRST WHEN IT COMES OUT OF THE BATTERY IT'S GOING A DIFFERENT WAY AND THEN WHEN IT'S COMING BACK IT'S GOING A DIFFERENT WAY
WELL I I THINK IT'S ABOUT LIKE THE BATTERY GIVING OUT ENERGY IT'S LIKE A CIRCUIT
YES BECAUSE IF YOU PUT IT THE WRONG WAY WHEN YOU ARE PUTTING IN ON A BATTERY THE BATTERY WON'T WORK
ANY PART THAT'S THE METAL THE ELEC- ELECTRICITY WOULD GO THROUGH THERE
IT'S GOING THE SAME WAY BECAUSE <BREATH> WHEN WHEREVER IT STARTS IT'S GOING AROUND AND COMING BACK TO THE SAME PLACE
CAUSE IF IT WASN'T TOUCHING THE METAL IT WOULD THE ENERGY WOULDN'T GO THROUGH SO THE LIGHTBULB WILL LIGHT
OK WELL UM IF YOU THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE BATTERY ONE IS THE PLUS AND ONE IS THE MINUS AND SOMETIMES IN A IF YOU ARE GOING TO PUT A BATTERY IN A REMOTE SOMETIMES IT'LL SAY PLUS AND SOMETIMES IT'LL IT'LL SAY PLUS AND MINUS BUT SOME BOTH BOTH OF THEM BUT SOMETIMES THE BATTERY DOESN'T HAVE ANY SIGNS T TO SAY WHERE IT GOES SO IF THERE'S A SPRING THAT MEANS THE MINUS SIDE OF THE BATTERY THE F THE PART THAT IS FLAT GOES UM LIKE GOES WH- WHERE THE SPRING IS LIKE AND THE PA PART THAT'S NOT LIKE DOESN'T GO WHERE THE SPRING IS
IT WAS FUN BECAUSE WE TRIED TO S UM MAKE A MAGNET GO THROUGH PAPER TO TEST IF IT WOULD UM GET CONNECT TO ANOTHER MAGNET
BECAUSE THE MAGNET HAS ENOUGH ENERGY THAT <FP> IT'S ENERGY IS STRONGER THAN THE THICK PAPER SO <BREATH> WHEN YOU PUT THE MAGNET BELOW AND YOU PUT A PAPER CLIP IT'LL STILL STICK BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET'S POW
GOODBYE SUZANNE
TODAY UM WE LEARNED ABOUT PEACE HOW IT'S GOOD TO HAVE PEACE AND NO DRUGS AND ALL THOSE OTHER STUFF
YOU'RE WELCOME
I'M GOOD
THEY WERE TRYING TO LIKE TEST US IF THE PAPER CLIP COULD STICK STILL WITH THE PAPER IN THE MIDDLE AND THE MAGNET BELOW
YES EXACTLY
OKAY
I MEANT LIKE YOU PUT A MAGNET ON TOP OF PAPER AND PUT ANOTHER MAGNET AND TRY TO SEE IF IT WOULD STICK AND YOU PUT ANOTHER AND YOU PUT A MAGNET ON TOP ON BELOW THE PAPER AND YOU PUT PAPER CLIPS
IT HELPED US LEARN MORE ABOUT MAGNETS BECAUSE <FP> IT IT HELPED US LEARN THAT IF YOU SCRATCH SOMETHING THAT COULD STICK TO A MAGNET AND IF YOU MATCH IT WITH THAT THE SAME THING LIKE A NAIL IF YOU <BREATH> SCRATCH IT IN THE MAGNET AND IF YOU MATCH IT WITH ANOTHER NAIL <BREATH> YOU WOULD STILL UM IT WOULD MAGNETIZE
OKAY
YES
I DON'T KNOW
WE TRIED TO UM TRY TO STICK MAGNET WE PUT MAGNETS BELOW AND TRY TO STICK ANOTHER MAGNET <FP> WITH IT AFTER WE WERE DONE WITH THAT WE PUT <BREATH> A MAGNET BELOW THE PAPER AGAIN AND THEN WE NOT TWO MAGNETS ONLY ONE AND THEN WE PUT PAPER CLIPS ON TOP OF IT
IT WAS TO GET ENOUGH ENERGY IN THE M M IN THE PAPER CLIP THAT IT WOULD STICK TO ANOTHER ONE
YES
I'M GOOD
I DON'T KNOW
THE MAGNET BELOW THE <BREATH> MAG THE MAGNET THAT'S BELOW IS MOVING THE MAGNET THAT'S ON TOP SO SO IF IT WAS MORE THICKER THEN THE MAGNET WOULDN'T MOVE BECAUSE IT'S TOO THICK <BREATH> AND IF IT SINCE IT'S LIKE PERFECT YOU COULD SCH- THE MAGNET COULD STILL HAVE ENOUGH ME ENERGY THAT IT'LL GO
YES AND WAR IS BAD TOO BUT PEACE IS REALLY GOOD SO WE <FP> MADE P POSTERS A FOR PEACE
YES I REALLY WAS
YES IT DID BECAUSE OF THE SCRATCHING
TODAY I MADE POSTERS PEACE POSTERS
UM THE MAGNET IS MOVING THE PAPER CLIP AROUND THE PAPER
I'M GOOD
YES WE TRIED TO SCRATCH PAPER CLIPS ON <FP> ON THE MAGNET TO SEE IF IT WOULD STICK TO OTHER PAPER CLIPS
YES
ACTUALLY I MEANT LIKE WE PUT LIKE TAPE LIKE <FP> IT'S LIKE A SWITCH <FP> IT'S LI IT'S A BOX AND THERE'S A METAL UM HANDLE THERE YOU PUT IT BELOW THE WIRE AND <FP> YOU PUT A WIRE ON INSI- THERE'S WHERE Y THERE'S SOME THERE'S A PLACE WHERE YOU COULD PUT THE WIRE AND YOU PUT <BREATH> THE STICK BELOW THE WIRE AND THEN THE MOTOR WILL CONTINUE <BREATH> CONTINUE GOING ON WITHOUT STOPPING
-UT WELL YOU HAVE TO PUT UM ONE PART OF THE WI- ONE PART OF THE MOTOR'S WIRE IN ONE OF THE CLIPS AND THE OTHER PART YOU HAVE TO STICK IT IN THE <BREATH> UM BATTERY'S MINUS SIGN AND THE OTHER IS YEAH YOU GET THE OTHER WIRE YOU GET FROM THE THERE ARE TWO CLIPS NEXT TO THE BATTERIES AND ONE IS IN FRONT OF YOU AND ONE IS BEHIND SO THE M ONE MOTOR'S ONE OF THE MOTOR'S BATTERY HAS TO GO IN THAT CLIP AND ONE <BREATH> THE EXTRA WIRE HAS TO GO IN ON THAT CLIP SO SO IT CAN D SO THE MOTOR CAN WORK
WELL Y
I THINK A CIRCUIT IS LIKE A CIRCLE BECAUSE UH UM WERE THE C I R IS PAR WHAT STARTS YOU WHAT STARTS WITH A CIRCLE SO UM LIKE A CIRCUIT IS A CIRCLE LIKE RIGHT NOW THERE'S LIKE IN FRONT OF ME THERE'S A CIRCUIT
WELL IF YOU HAVE THEM IN ORDER THEN YOU'LL ALWAYS WORK BUT IF YOU IF Y IF THE WIRES WEREN'T IN THE CLIP THEY WON'T WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE <BREATH> YOU HAVE TO HOLD IT WITH YOUR HAND AND IT WOULD STILL WORK BUT IT WOULDN'T WORK THAT AS GREAT <FP> AS PUTTING THEM IN THE CLIP
WELL LIKE WE WHEN WE GOT THE UM SWITCH THERE WERE TWO WIRE CARRIERS ONE FOR THE EXTRA WIRE THAT WE GOT AND ONE FOR THE MOTORS <BREATH> SO WE GOT WE HAD TO PUT THEM IN THERE TO MAKE THE MOTOR GO OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T GO
ALL THE RIGHT PLACES IN THE IT MEANS LIKE YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM IN THE CLIPS BECAUSE <BREATH> IF
TODAY LIKE WE WERE STUDYING ABOUT ELECTRICITY AND THEN WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE A MOTOR LIKE SPIN AND THEN WE FIRST WE GOT TO DO IT WITH BATTERY AND THE MOTOR'S UM WIRE THAT'S IT AND THEN WE GOT A SWITCH AND THEN LATER WE <BREATH> <FP> PUT THE BATTERY IN WHERE THE BATTERY WAS SUPPOSED TO GO AND THE S <BREATH> MOTOR AND THEN WE GOT A SWITCH WE HAD TO CONNECT THE WIRES AND MAKE IT L INTO A SWITCH SO IT WOULD TURN ON AND OFF
THANKS
-ESE <FP> PLUS SIGN AND THEN YOU PUT IT ON <BREATH> AND THEN YOU PUT IT ON THE *WIRE* WIRE CARRIER AND THEN YOU GET THE STICK AND THEN YOU PUT IT UNDER IT
IT WILL WORK ALWAYS BUT IF YOU LIKE <BREATH> IF Y IF YOU DON'T STICK THE MOTOR INTO THE CLIPS AND YOU JUST MAKE IT TOUCH IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE THE <BREATH> UM THE WIRES WILL COME OUT QUICKLY
WELL AN ELECTRIC CIRCUIT IS WHEN YOU PU CONNECT THE MOTOR'S ONE OF THE MOTOR'S WIRE TO THE BATTERY <BREATH> NEXT TO THE BATTERY AND ONE OF THE OTHER <BREATH> WIRE RE INTO IN FRONT OF THE BATTERY AND ONE OF THE MOTOR'S RIGHT BEHIND IT <BREATH> AND WHEN YOU PUT THE THE ELECTRIC CIRCUIT SINCE THE BATTERY HAS ENOUGH POWER OF THE WIRES IT GOES THROUGH AND THEN IT M AND THEN IT TH IT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
WELL UM THE BATTERY ONE PART OF THE BATTERY IS CONNECTING TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU PUT <FP> THE MMM LIKE ONE PART OF THE P LIKE WELL THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT WIRES AND ONE WIRE F FROM THE BATTERY'S PLUS SIGN IS GOING TO THE <BREATH> THE WIRE CARRIER AND THE OTHER WIRE FROM THE BATTERY IS GOING TO FROM THE MOTOR IS GOING TO THE BATTERY AND THERE'S THIS OTHER ONE WHERE YOU PUT IT AND THE BATTERY CARRIER FROM THE WI- UM FROM THE MOTOR
INK THE MOTOR WON'T STAY ON FOR A LONG TIME IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE WRONG PLACE <BREATH> THE MOTOR WON'T WORK
WELL IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE LIKE THE WIRES IN THE RIGHT PLACE IF YOU HAD THEM IN THE WRONG PLACE FIRST YOU WON'T GET ENOUGH ENERGY TO MAKE THE MOTOR MOVE AND THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK TOO
WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN IT'S IT'S A COMPLETE CIRCUIT BUT WHEN THE SWITCH IS NOT OPEN IT'S LIKE HALF A CIRCUIT BECAUSE <BREATH> THE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IS NOT WORKING AND WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IS WORKING
<BREATH> THE CLIP THAT'S NEXT TO THE BATTERY THE BATTERY'S UM <FP> POWER INSIDE THE BATTERY IS GOING TO LIT AND THEN THE OTHER PART OF THE WIRE'S GOING THERE AND THEN <BREATH> THE ONE OF THE MOTOR'S WIRE'S GOING IN THE CLIP AND THEN WHEN YOU UM PULL PUT THAT UNDERNEATH ONE OF THEM YOU CAN N START THE M
WELL THE SWITCH WAS LIKE YOU WAS TRYING TO LIKE <BREATH> PUT IT BELOW THE WIRES SO THE BATTERY THE MOTOR COULD CONTINUE AND SPINNING AND THEN AFTER A WHILE WE HAD TO STOP BECAUSE THE BATTERY <BREATH> WE WANTED TO SAVE THE BATTERY
WELL THE SWITCH YOU HAVE TO PUT IT UNDER ONE OF THE CLIPS AND THEN THE MOTOR WILL START T START RUNNING
ALWAYS BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT PLACE YOU PUT EM
WELL
WELL YOU HAVE TO PUT IT THERE ARE TWO SIDES OF THE BATTERY YOU HAVE TO PUT ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY IN THE ONE SIDE OF THE S WIRE IN THE BATTERY'S MINUS AND ONE SIDE <BREATH> ON THE UM SWITCH SO AND THEN YOU GET ANOTHER WIRE WHICH WA IT'S RED AND YOU PUT IT ON THE M PLUS SIGN YOU PUT THE MOTOR'S WIRE ON THE MINUS AND WA AND ONE OF THE MOTOR'S WIRE ON THE UM WHERE YOU PUT THE WIRE <FP> YOUR UH FROM THE SWITCH AND THEN YOU GET ANOTHER WIRE THAT'S RED AND YOU PUT IT <BREATH> ON TH
WELL THE SWITCH WHEN YOU PUT THE WIRES <BREATH> WELL THE SWITCH WHEN YOU PUT EVERYTHING IN PLACE YOU S PUT THE SWITCH UNDER ONE OF THE WIRES AND THEN THE MOTOR WILL START WORKING BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY FROM <FP> IT LIKE FROM THE WIRE FROM ONE PART OF THE WIRE IT'S GOING TH TO THE SWITCH AND THEN WHEN YOU PUT IT UNDER THEY BOTH ARE WORKING SO AND THEN IT THE MOTOR WORKS
WELL IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE <BREATH> WHEN YOU ATTACH THE WIRES AND YOU PUT EVERYTHING IN THE RIGHT PLACE THEN THE MOTOR WILL START WORKING AND YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT MOTORS
YES
MINUS PLACE AND ONE PART OF <BREATH> AND THEN THE OTHER PART OF THE WIRE ON THE PLUS PLACE SO IT WILL STILL WORK YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT WITH THE SWITCH
WELL THEY'RE A DIFFER THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY YOU CAN DO IT YOU COULD <BREATH> JUST UM GET THE BATTERY AND THE MOTOR AND PUT ONE WIRE OF THE MOTOR UNDERNEATH THE BATTER
WELL BECAUSE OF THE UM BATTERY THE MOTOR HAS ENOUGH POWER THAT IT WILL START GOING
THE POWER IS LIKE SINCE YOU'RE CONNECTING ONE OF THE WIRES OF THE MOTOR
YES
THEY ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU J D HAVE HAD THEM IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MO MOTOR WON'T START WORKING
YES
-EPENDS
YEAH MMM HMM
MMM I DON'T RE I DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER ANYMORE
UM MEASURING WATER MEASURING THE SODA CANS AND HOW MUCH WATER CAN TAKE
HELLO
UH-HUH YEAH SO
WE WERE MEASURING
THAT IT HAD WATER ON SO KNOW WHEN WE GOT IT YEAH
YEAH
WE PUT IT THE SYRI- WE GOT THIS CUP <FP> WITH WITH MEASURE WE GOT SOME WATER AND THEN WE TOOK THE SYRINGE WE TOOK THE WATER AND THEN WE PUT IT IN THE CAN
UM WELL LIKE THE WATER TO PUT WITH THE SYRINGE LIKE THAT SO LIKE SHOT AND THEN WE PUT IT YEAH <LAUGH> UH-HUH
YEAH
OH MMM WE JUST WANTED IT TO USE THAT AND NOT SOMETHING MORE BIG LIKE JUST SODA CANS
MMM WE PUT SOME WATER LIKE THAT AND THEN WE PUT IN THE CAN
LIKE LIKE IF IT'S SM- THE SMALL NUMBER OR BIG NUMBER LIKE HOW MANY'S IN THE W IN THE CANNED HOW MANY WATER SO
I DON'T KNOW LIKE OUR T WE WERE PUTTING OUR TEACHER PUT IN THE WATER AND THEN WE DIDN'T KNOW BUT UM WE F WHEN WE GOT THE UM WE WE HEARD THAT THERE WAS WATER A LITTLE BIT WATER SO THAT'S WHY
UM THAT TH WE PUT WATER N UH HOW MANY IT IS IT HEAVY OR HO WHICH NUMBER LIKE HOW IS IT
CHANGES
BECAUSE <BREATH> TH IT'S MORE BETTER THAN MEASURE IT DOWN BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T KNOW WHICH NUMBER WAS IT LIKE IT'S TOO HARD <BREATH> <LAUGH>
THREE OR A HUNDRED THE CUP HUNDRED
UM IT SOMETIMES FALLS OFF BECAUSE TINY LIKE WHERE THE SKY FALLS LIKE THE THE THE WHEN IT RAINS THOSE IT IT FALLS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT <LAUGH> YEAH IT DRIPS SOMETIMES AND SO WE PUT SOME A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THEN WE DO IT QUICKLY AND THEN WE SPRAY IT LIKE THAT IT'S FUN
SO IT COULDN'T DROP WATER BECAUSE WE COULDN'T KNOW WHICH NUMBER
YEAH
UH <BREATH> WHAT NUMBER WAS IT
BEC UM BECAUSE WE COULDN'T KNOW IT'S IT COULD DROP <BREATH> LIKE THE WATER AND THEN WE'LL HAVE DIFFERENT NUMBERS YEAH WE JUST HAD TO DO IT WITH A SYRINGE YEAH S YEAH MORE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YOU CAN MEASURE IT DOWN LIKE WE CAN MEASURE IT WE MEASURE IN MY TEAM WE MEASURE IT UP BUT SOME TEAMS THEY MEASURE IT LIKE LOW LOW YEAH
LIKE <BREATH> YOU HAVE TO DO THE SAME NUMBER AS THE LITTLE ONE THE SYRINGE BIG SYRINGE LIKE THAT YOU HAVE TO MEASURE IT LIKE SAME SAME
UM PUTTING HOW MUCH WATER DOES IT TAKE IN THE SODA CAN
MMM WHEN MILLILITERS YEAH <BREATH>
MMM NO YEAH BUT THE SYRINGE HAD BIG SYRINGES AND LITTLE SYRINGES
UM OUR TEACHER PUTS THE NUM- THE NUMBER WHICH PEOPLE DOES IT IF THEY HAVE THE LOW NUMBER OR THE BASE NUMBER BECAUSE WE GOT IT WITH SHE PUT IT A LITTLE BIT OF WATER WHEN WE GOT IT YEAH LIKE THAT MMM EVERYBODY EVERYBODY HAD THE SAME NUMBER AND SOME HAD THE DIFFERENT NUMBER
MMM IT'S NOT THE SAME NUMBER YEAH
UM LIKE <BREATH>
YEAH
HMM <BREATH> TEACHER WANTED TO GET DIFFERENT NUMBERS SHE DOESN'T I THINK SHE DOESN'T WANT TO WRITE THE SAME NUMBER ALL THE TIME <BREATH> I THINK
I DON'T KNOW WE JUST DID THAT
<BREATH> LIKE HOW LIKE
I THINK UP <BREATH> YEAH
MMM WE HAD THESE STUFF WITH LIKE THOSE YEAH SYRINGE AND WE PUT IT IN A SODA YEAH BUT NOT IT DIDN'T HAVE NOTHING IN IT LIKE YEAH AND WE PUT SOME IN IT HOW MANY DOES IT TAKE AND WE WERE <BREATH> IN OUR JOURNAL WE WERE PUTTING HOW MUCH TOOK YEAH AND AND MMM
OUR T OH S TO MEASURE HOW MANY LIKE SODA COULD IT FIT AND OUR TEACHER COULD PUT THE NUMBER IN THE IN THE <BREATH> CHART LIKE THAT SO HOW MANY YOU GOT SOME HAD DIFFERENT BECAUSE UM WHEN WE GOT THE BA- THE CAN <BREATH> OUR TEACHER PUT IN A LITTLE WATER SO WE COULD HAD DIFFERENT NUMBERS YEAH JUST A LITTLE BIT YEAH MMM HMM
WE DID IT SO WE CAN'T KNOW IF IT WAS LITTLE WATER OR OR BIG N WATER WE WE DIDN'T WANT TO *SHAKE* IT SO THE WA S IF IT WAS UP AND THE WATER COULD FALL OFF AND WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW WHICH NUMBER SO WE PUT IT ON SOMETHING AND WE MEASURED IT HOW MANY CAUSE IT WAS HEAVY
MMM WE TOLD THE TEACHER WHY DO THEY HAVE AND THEN WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW LIKE I THINK WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH SYRINGES LIKE LITTLE SYRINGES YEAH
YEAH WE GOT THE LITTLE ONE <BREATH> YEAH
YEAH
UM BECAUSE WE SAW LIKE THE WATER WAS COMING UP UP UP UP THAT'S WHAT THAT'S HOW WE KNEW <BREATH> WE WE SHAKED IT A LITTLE BIT UM AND THEN WE SAW WAS HEAVY IF IT WAS HEAVY WE PUT IT ON S SOMETHING TO MEASURE IT IF IT'S W IF IT WAS HEAVY OR YEAH A LITTLE BIT
BECAUSE LIKE IT'S BIGGER A LITTLE BIT AND IT HAS LIKE A THING INSIDE
AND THIS ONE'S LOWER AND THIS ONE'S HIGHER
OKAY
WITH SOME THINGS <FP> WE CAN MEASURE WITH TWO THINGS WITH A RULER YOU CAN GRAB IT AND THEN YOU CAN PUT SOME THINGS AND THEN IT GOES DOWN WHICH THING IS HEAVY OR SMALL
WHICH IS THE NUMBER
IT
MMM THEY SAW TWENTY OR THIRTY OR TEN YEAH
IT COULD
WE HAD THE LITTLE BLOCKS AND WE S LITTLE TINY BLOCKS AND LET'S SEE HOW MANY BLOCKS DO WE TAKE <BREATH>
YEAH <BREATH> THE UH OTHER BALL YEAH BECAUSE IT IT'S MORE THE OTHER ONE IS MORE LIGHTER AND THE ORANGE AND THE WHITE IS MORE HEAVIER BECAUSE IT HAD SOMETHING INSIDE THAT IT'S HEAVY THAN THE ORANGE
MMM NO <BREATH>
MMM YEAH <BREATH> SOME THINGS THAT ARE HEAVY AND SOME THINGS THAT ARE LOW
WE HAD THAT HOMEWORK A HOMEWORK AND IT HAD WE HAD TO MEASURE UM THINGS YOU HAVE TO PUT THE NAME WHAT IT'S CALLED AND WHAT LENGTH YOU TAKE A GUESS TWO GUESSES AND THEN YOU MEASURE IT AND IF YOU WERE WRONG THEN MMM YOU JUST PUT THE ANSWER
LIKE S MMM HMM YEP <BREATH>
THE CORK <BREATH> MMM HMM
AND THEY'RE SMALL SOME THINGS ARE SMALL BUT HEAVY AND SOME <BREATH> ARE BIG BUT THEY'RE UM LIKE <BREATH> S LIKE MMM LIGHT
UM KEYS HOW HEAVY THEY ARE BUT THEY'RE LITTLE AND <BREATH>
WE PUT THE ANSWER IN
YEAH WITH WITH OUR BODY WITH WITH OUR LEGS OUR ARMS HOW WHICH HOW MANY
NO LIKE DIFFERENT STUFF
UM <BREATH> THE WOOD
YEAH IT'S LOWER
IT'S BECAUSE UM SOME PEOPLE WHEN THEY GOT IT THEY HAVE THEIR JOURNAL THEY PUT IT THE ANSWER WE WRITE WORDS WHAT HOW MMM HOW HEAVY OR HOW WHICH ONE'S HEAVIER YEAH
TURKEY TURKEY
I DON'T KNOW <LAUGH>
BECAUSE UM DO YOU SEE THIS UM IT'S LIKE IT GOES THIS WAY IF IT GOES THIS WAY IT'S THAT ONE'S LIGHTER AND THAT ONE'S HEAVIER
UM NO <BREATH>
UM WE GOT LIKE
UM THE CORK UM WAS UM WE HAD TO PUT IT TOOK LIKE UM FOURTEEN YEAH
MMM IT'S MORE HEAVIER THAN THE LIGHTER
AND <BREATH>
NO <BREATH>
YEAH <BREATH>
MMM NO NONE OF THOSE OH YES SOME OF THOSE WE ONLY GOT THE LITTLE ONES YEAH <BREATH>
BLO- BLOCKS
IT'S MORE EASIER THAN PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE PAPER CLIPS ARE MORE AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PUT LOTS OF THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO LITTLE
LIKE ONE OF THOSE TAKE THEM <BREATH>
MMM THE LITTLE BOX NO TH YEAH THE LITTLE BOX
THEY NO WE WERE WE COULD
BECAUSE <BREATH> MMM <BREATH> IT IT IT HAS LIKE A THINGIE THAT YOU KNOW IF IT GOES THIS WAY OR *THAT* WAY LIKE A STICK
MMM OUR OR LIKE UM WE'LL SHOW THEM AGAIN LIKE
BLOCKS
UM WE PUT UM THE KEY IN THE CUP IN THE CUP SO IT DOESN'T FALL AND THEN WE PUT THE WOOD UM IN ANOTHER CUP AND THE KEY'S MORE UM HEAVY THAN THE L THAN THE WOOD
SHOW THEM IN A JOURNAL LIKE
YEAH LIKE LIKE SOMETHING LIKE SOME THINGS THAT YOU PUT IN THE WATER THOSE THINGS YEAH LIKE CORKS WE MEASURE THOSE TOO <BREATH>
UM BECAUSE WE SOMETIMES PEOPLE PUT EM IN THE PAPER THEY COPY IT THE THAT AND THEN THEY CUT IT OUT AND THEN THEY SHOW THEM
NO BECAUSE SOME WILL GRAB BIG ONES SOME WILL GRAB LITTLE ONES
UM THE P *PAPER* CLIPS AND THE BOXES SAME OF THEM YEAH
MMM OUR ARM HOW MANY ARMS LIKE TWO ARMS OR ONE ARM IN OR OUR HAND IF IT'S SOMETHING SMALL WE MEASURE LIKE BOOK HOW MANY HANDS IF IT'S BIG WE MEASURE LIKE Y YOU TAKE A GUESS HOW MANY ARM HOW MANY HANDS LIKE YOU PICK TWO AND THEN YOU HAVE TO MEASURE THIS PART OR AND THIS PART HOW MANY HANDS AND I PICKED ONE AND THE ON THIS PART AND WE PICK AND I THINK TWO MMM
IT HAS DIFFERENT COLORS LIKE DIFFERENT COLORS <LAUGH> <BREATH>
UH IF IT DOESN'T GO STRAIGHT LIKE STRAIGHT LIKE UP TO HERE UM E IT'S NOT LIKE BALANCED AND SO WE NEED TO PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE
UM THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THAT LITTLE THING LIKE IF IT GOES THIS WAY IT'S LIKE THAT ONE'S HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER ONE
I THINK BAD
BECAUSE ONE IS MIDDLE AND ONE IS LIKE
SOME YOU HAVE THE SAME BUT SOME PEOPLE LIKE THEY PUT LIKE FIVES THEY DO FIVES ARE LIKE SAME AS TWENTY LIKE FIVE AND FIVE PLUS FIVE AND FIVE MAKES TWENTY SO WE THE THEY PUT LIKE DIFFERENT BLOCKS LIKE OF THOSE HOW MANY <BREATH>
AND WE MEASURED DIFFERENT LIKE UH A SHIP LIKE
LIKE IT'S SO LIGHT LIKE ONE IS MIDDLE AND ONE IS
NO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE <BREATH> NO WE DIDN'T NO NO
MMM PRETTY WELL WE YEAH
IF IT'S IN THE MIDDLE THE THE THING BECAUSE WE CAN'T START IF IF IT'S ANOTHER WAY WE IF IT'S ANOTHER WAY WE PUT SOMETHING HARD LIKE IN THE BACK SO IT GOES THE S IN STRAIGHT
S <BREATH>
AND THEY TOOK US THIRTEEN WITH THE SHIP AND WITH <BREATH> THE RED COIN W IT TOOK US UM
YEAH
YEAH
GOOD EVERY IN IN IN MY CLASS THEY HAD DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT HAD LITTLE AND L LIKE HOW MANY THEY GOT LIKE THIRTEEN
HOW MANY THE <BREATH> UM IT TOOK TO LIKE
GOOD THE LITTLE BLOCKS UM
A CHIP LIKE A WOOD CHIP AND THAT WAS LIGHT THEN LIKE A <BREATH>
LIKE YEAH
A LITTLE COIN LIKE NOT LIKE A REAL COIN LIKE ONE OF THOSE RED COINS MMM THOSE
THERE'S LIKE YOU PUT TEN PAPER CLIPS BUT IT'S STILL NOT <BREATH> EVEN LIKE IT THAT WANTS MORE HARD IN THE PAPER CLIPS IF YOU MEASURE THE BIG PAPER CLIPS IT'LL IT'LL DO IT TENS BUT IF YOU MEASURE THE LITTLE CLIPS IT WON'T DO IT
YEAH YEAH WE WE DID HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS TO GET IN THE MIDDLE UM AND WE COUNT THEM HOW MANY DID WE PUT
DIFFERENT THINGS
UH OKAY
MI EVERYBODY HAD LIKE THIRTEEN FIFTEEN TWENTY DIFFERENT
YEAH MMM HMM LIKE S
UM THE TWENTIES ARE BIG UM MORE MORE S UM LIKE HEAVY AND THE THEY THE THOSE WERE LIKE LITTLE HEAVY LIKE WE
WE WE <BREATH> WE SAW HOW MANY IT TOOK TO TO MADE IT STRAIGHT LIKE HOW MANY IT HOW MANY PENS WE COUNT EM HOW MANY WHAT THEY TOOK YEAH
LIKE A LITTLE THING LIKE A HARD IT'S A LITTLE AND IT'S SO HARD CAUSE IT'S LIKE METAL AND N YEAH YEAH <BREATH> UM WE MEASURED WE HAD UM THESE SQUARES LITTLE SQUARES UM THAT WE WERE PUTTING HOW MANY IT TOOK FOR THE THAT THE HEAVY STUFF
NO NOT THOSE
MMM HMM SMALL BIGGER
NOPE
UM <BREATH> LIKE
THE PAPER CLIPS WERE JUST LIKE THE LITTLE BLOCKS UM WE WE BUT SOME WERE LIKE DIFFERENT LIKE HOW MANY YOU MEASURE IT WITH THE LITTLE BLOCKS AND WE MEASURE IT WITH THE PAPER CLIPS HOW MANY IT TOOK
THE
YEAH
I FOR I FORGOT
YEAH
UM WE BEEN MEASURING THINGS AND WE'VE BEEN MEASURING LIKE HARD STUFF AND LIKE NOT EASY STUFF LIGHT STUFF
THE OTHER ONE'S HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER ONE
LIKE
YEAH MMM
UM IT'S IT'S HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER ONE
LIKE MMM
THE PAPER CLIPS WERE JUST LIKE THE LITTLE BLOCKS LIKE LITTLE BLOCKS AND WE <BREATH> WE THE L THE LIT
UM ANY NOBODY UM MEASURES THE THE SAME UM THEY MEASURE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE
WITH
FIFTEEN
YEAH
UH SOME HAVE MIDDLE AND SOME HAVE <BREATH> YEAH
YEAH
WE HAVE TO KNOW WHICH MEASURES IT LIKE <BREATH> WHAT HOW <BREATH> IF WE DON'T MEASURE AND WE JUST GUESS WE HAVE TO DO IT UM IF WE IF THEY DON'T DO DON'T MEASURE IT UM THEY THEY WILL BE WRONG LIKE IT'LL BE WRONG
Y
UM LIKE <BREATH> S SOME SOMEWHERE LIKE
YEAH
MMM IN SOMEWHERE LIKE THEY WERE RIGHT SOMEWHERE LIKE THEY WERE WRONG THEY WERE ALMOST <FP>
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S LIKE NOT BALAN LIKE THE OTHER ONE'S HEAVIER AND THE OTHER ISN'T BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME BUT IN THEY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE INSIDE THAT IN THAT ISN'T THE SAME AS THAT ONE
BECAUSE SOME HAVE LIKE IT'S IT'S BIG AND SOME ARE SMALL AND IT'S LIGHTER THE OTHER ONE THE THE OTHER ONE'S HEAVIER
YEAH WITH THE UH-HUH
OUR TEACHER UM PUT IT LIKE WHEN WE GOT THE CO THAT THE CAN OF COKE UM OUR TEACHER PUT IT A LOT OF WATER LIKE A LITTLE BIT LIKE UP TO HERE AND THEN WE GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS UM I GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS AND SOME MMM SAME BECAUSE TEACHER DIDN'T PUT LIKE SOME DIDN'T OUR TEACHER SOME DIDN'T SHE DIDN'T PUT UM ONE OF THEM AND SOME SHE DID LIKE IN OUR GROUP SHE DID MMM HMM A LITTLE BIT SO WE CAN
AND THEN YEAH HMM
GOOD
WE HAVE BEEN
NO
MMM HMM WE GOT THIS CUP AND THEN WE PUT IT LIKE THAT AND THEN WE GOT THIS SYRINGE AND WE PUT IT LIKE THAT AND THEN WE PUT IT IN THE IN THE COKE
YEAH
YEAH
MMM <BREATH> WE GOT THE SYRINGE THAT ONE AND THEN WE D WE DID IT LIKE THAT SO LIKE THAT
YEAH SOME WERE THE SAME AND SOME WERE NOT THE SAME
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME NUMBER LIKE WE ONLY HAD WE AND A MA AND OUR GROUP WE HAD THE RE UM WITH THE OTHER GROUP UM WE HAD THE S SAME
UM WE HAVE TH THESE STUFF WITH MMM <BREATH> WELL LIKE WE HAVE LIKE WHAT ARE THOSE CALLED LIKE
I WAS THE ONLY GIRL
MMM MEASURING WATER BOTTLES
MMM SO THAT LIKE TO THE MMM HMM
THERE WAS BOYS IN MY GROUP ONLY BOYS IN THE UM GIRLS I WAS JUST THE ONLY GIRL IN THAT GROUP MMM HMM
UM WE WROTE THE ANSWER AND THEN UM OUR TEACHER UM COULD WRITE THE ANSWER UM BUT IT WAS DIFFERENT EVERYBODY BECAUSE THEY HAD THE SAME THE SAME AMOUNTS BUT THERE WAS WHEN WE GOT THOSE UM THE COKES UM WE WE S WE UM WE SHOOK IT AND THEN WE SAW LIKE IT HAD A LITTLE BIT WATER SO EVERYBODY HAD A DIFFERENT ANSWER
UM DIFFERENT NUMBERS L AND OF UM HOW MANY DID YOU PUT BE YEAH BECAUSE UM IT HAD A AND WHEN WE GOT THAT UM OUR TEACHER JUST PUT IT UM O UH A SCOOP OF WATER A LITTLE BIT AND THEN WE THOUGHT THAT WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF OF WE <BREATH> LIKE
WE WE GOT LIKE <BREATH> WE HAD LIKE SODA LIKE COKES LIKE IT DIDN'T HAVE NOTHING INSIDE TO LIKE THE WE JUST UM GOT THAT UM HOW MANY UM WE HAVE A CUP AND THEN WE GOT THE WATER AND UP TO A HUNDRED AND THEN WE GOT THAT AND THEN WE TOOK IT <FP> UP SO WE CAN SEE HOW MANY UM SCOOPS DO WE HAD TO GET IT UP THE WATER UP IN THE COKE
YEAH NOT WATER LIKE A LITTLE BIT SO SHE CAN SEE HOW HOW DIFFERENT IT IS EVERYBODY HAS A DIFFERENT NUMBER
UM YEAH
UM THE THAT ONE THAT YOU TAKE WATER AND THEN Y YEAH AND THEN YOU YEAH IT IT LIKE SOMETIMES IT FALLS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT YEAH
MMM KIND OF
MMM NO SOME WAS LEFT THERE WE SOMEWHERE UM IT'S BECAUSE SOME SPILLED THE WATER LIKE THAT AND THEN THEY GOT ALL OF THE WATER AND SO AND IN OUR GROUP WE WE HAD LOTS OF WATER LEFT M MMM HMM
BECAUSE TH THESE WERE THE SAME BUT UM OUR TE YEAH BUT OUR TEACHER PUT IT UM SOME MORE WATER A LITTLE BIT SO WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT ANSWERS
YEAH MMM HMM
NO WE WE GOT THIS CUP LIKE IT'S A HUNDRED AND YOU GO TO A HUNDRED AND YOU GOT IT LIKE GOT IT LIKE THIS BUT WE GOT IT ALL THE WAY AT THE TOP SO WE TOOK A LITTLE BIT AND THEN WE STOOD IT LIKE THERE MMM HMM
MMM WE'VE BEEN MEASURE WATER LIKE BOTTLES LIKE <FP> YEAH
MMM MMM HMM YEAH
YEAH SOME WERE DIFFERENT BECAUSE SOME WERE BIGGER AND SOME WERE SMALLER WE GOT THE SMALLER ONE BECAUSE NOT LOTS OF THEM LIKE THOSE BIG ONES NO LIKE UM THE SYRINGE BIG ONES THEY HAD LIKE THESE IT BUT WE HAD THE LITTLE ONE
MMM HMM YEAH
LIKE IN THE DEXTE- IT'S LIKE UM WET THE DESK BECAUSE WE SPILLED LOTS OF WATER
MMM I DON'T REMEMBER ANYMORE
UM WE WRITE THE ANSWER WHAT WAS IT IN
MMM HMM OUR TEACHER PUT LIKE UM WATER IN SOMETHING LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS UH-HUH
YEAH MMM HMM
I THINK IT WILL NOT LIGHT AS BRIGHT BECAUSE IF EACH CIRCUIT HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY THERE IS EVEN MORE ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB
YES THERE WAS TWO BATTERY
<SILENCE> IT'S BECAUSE THERE IS ONLY THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY AND WHEN SO NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH IT BECAUSE EACH LIGHT BULB NEEDS ELECTRICITY IN THE MAD ELECTRICITY
I NOTICE THAT THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS A WIRE THAT
I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT UP WILL BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE- I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS WILL BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEY- BECAUSE THEY EACH HAVE MORE ELECTRICITY
A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
BECAUSE THERE'S TWICE A MUCH ELECTRICI- OR ENERGY IF YOU HAVE TWO D-CELLS INSTEAD OF ONE
I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE- THERE ARE- EACH LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY BUT WHICH ON THE BOTTOM IT ONLY HAS ONE CIRCUIT PATHWAY
THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING FROM THE RIGHT HAND LIGHT BULB FROM THE SIDE OF IT AND GOING THROUGH THE WIRE AND IN TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D-CELL
I NOTICE THAT THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES ARE CONNECTING EACH OTHER BUT IT'S ONLY USING EVEN MY (*) OTHER ONE WHICH IS USING TO
I NOTICE THAT THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY GOING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND COMES OUT THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE TWO WIRES CONNECTING THERE SO YOU HAVE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
A LIGHT BULB DOES HAVE ITS OWN PATHWAY BECAUSE THERE IS TWO SEPARATE- THERE IS TWO SEPARATE CIRCUITS GOING ON
I OBSERVED THAT THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE PATHWAYS FOR EACH ELECTRICITY PATHWAY TO FLOW THROUGH BECAUSE THERE'S A EXTRA WIRE ON THE BOTTOM SO ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THAT AND IT CREATES ITS OWN PATHWAY FOR THE LEFT-HAND LIGHT BULB
I NOTICE THAT THE ELECTRICITY COME FROM THE SIDE OF THE SECOND OF THE RIGHT HAND LIGHT BULB AND GOES INTO THE POSITIVE
I OBSERVE THAT ARE TWO PATHWAYS SO THE ELECTRICITY CAN GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT SO THE FLOW IS THAT GOES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WITH THE LEFT HAND SIDE BECAUSE IT GONE UP INTO THE BOTTOM AND THEN IT GOES INTO THE SECOND WIRE CONNECTING TO THE LEFT HAND LIGHT BULB AND THAT CREATE ANOTHER CIRCUIT PATHWAYS OF FLOW
WELL THE SETUP IS THERE'S FOUR WIRES AND ONE D-CELL AND TWO LIGHT BULBS SO THE WIRES THERE- YOU HAVE TWO WIRES ON EACH END OF THE D-CELL AND EACH OF THE WIRES CONNECTS TO ONE OF THE LIGHT- ONE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULBS
I THINK THE FLOW GOES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS
WHEN YOU ROLL OVER IT IT SHOWS YOU THAT THEY EACH HAVE THEIR OWN- THEY EACH HAVE THEIR OWN CIRCUIT SO THEY EACH HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY FOR ELECTRICITY TO FLOW SO- SO WHEN EACH OF THEM HAS THE FLOW THEY CAN ALL ABSORB THE ENOUGH AMOUNT ELECTRICITY TO MAKE THEM LIGHT REALLY BRIGHT
THE END IN A BATTERY WERE ELECTRICITY LEAVES YOU JUST CONNECTS TO ONE WIRE CONNECTING TO THE BOTTOM
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNET
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH PARALLEL CIRCUIT
I KNOW BECAUSE THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY IF THERE WAS TWO PATHWAYS FOR EACH LIGHT BULB THEY WOULD BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE ELECTRICITY
IT LOOKS DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU’RE USING TWO LIGHT BULBS
SOMETHING MUST GOING ON WITH THE DIRECTION OF FLOW IT IS THAT EACH THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT FLOW SYSTEMS BECAUSE THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS GOING ON
THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
VERY WELL HOW ABOUT YOU
THOSE COMPARE TO THE BOTTOM ONE THEY DON’T COMPARE TO THE BOTTOM ONES BECAUSE THE BOTTOM ONE ONLY HAS ONE CIRCUIT PATHWAY BUT IF YOU HAVE TWO CIR- TWO PATHWAYS FOR A CIRCUIT THEY FLOW- THEY EACH HAVE THEIR- EACH HAVE THE- THE BEST AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY THEY HAVE THE MOST AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THEY'RE- THEY HAVE THEIR OWN FLOW OF IT BECAUSE THERE'S TWO SEPARATE PATHWAYS
SOMETHING I NOTICE IS THAT A- THE LIGHT BULB WAS OFF BUT WHEN IT TOOK OUT AND YOU PUT A BACK AND IT WORKED
I REMEMBER THAT PATH THAT NOW HAS TO BE THE CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED IN THEIR CAMP ANY OPEN WIRES OF THE ELECTRICITY JUST IN JUST GO OUT
PATHWAY IS THERE IS CENSOR TWO DIFFERENT PATHS FOR HIS TWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS SO HAS TO TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS IN ORDER FOR THEM THE LIGHTER SO USING THE BATTERY THAT HAS TO BE THAT HAS TO BE TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO EACH SIGN AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BULB CONNECTING TUBE
SHARE WITH THE BOT THEY COMPARE WITH THE BOTTOM CIRCUIT BECAUSE THEY THEY EACH HAVE SOME LIGHT BUT THEY ALSO DON'T COMPARE BECAUSE THERE IS TWO PATH BECAUSE THAT LIGHT BULBS ARE ON THE TOP WERE BRIGHT
I THINK THE GIRL WAS EATING THEN ITS GIVING THAT ENERGY SO SHE CAN KEEP ON WALKING
YOU CAN SEE THAT IS WORKING BECAUSE THE WAX IS MELTING SO DO YOU CAN THAT THERE IS ENERGY BECAUSE IN IT THE FIRE AND THAT WAX IS MELTING THE
YES YOU CAN HEAR NOISE FROM THE DRUMS
THE AIR AROUND IT THEY COMES OFF SMOKY
ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE WORK AND WITHOUT THE ENERGY IS NOTHING WOULD WORK
THE GASOLINE AND THE COAL SIMILAR BECAUSE IT HAVE BURN THEM TO GET ENERGY
WE’VE BEEN LEARNING AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE A CIRCUIT BUT LIGHTING TWO LIGHT BULBS UPS AT THE SAME TIME
THE EVIDENCE OF ENERGY IS THAT THE LIGHT THAT THERE WAS A FIRE AND THE LIGHT IS THE
COAL AND GAS ARE BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE SOLAR PANEL AND THE WIND TURBINE ARE BECAUSE THEY DON’T POLLUTE AIR LIKE GASOLINE AND CHARCOAL
I SEE ALL FIELD FORCES THE GASOLINE BURNS TO MAKE ENERGY THE ROCK BURN TO MAKE ENERGY THE CANDLE BURNS TO MAKE ENERGY AND THE FOOD WHEN YOU ARE EAT THAT IT GIVES YOU ENERGY
THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE WIND TURBINE ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE GAS AND CHARCOAL BECAUSE THEY DON’T BURN THEY COLLECT IT THEIR STORED ENERGY AND CHARCOAL AND GAS AWAY IN IT
<SILENCE> COULD YOU
THE IMPACT FOR THE GASOLINE AND THEN CHARCOAL IS A BAD IMPACT BECAUSE IT POLLUTES THE AIR BUT WITH THE WIND TURBINE IN RESOURCE WELL IS A GOOD IMPACT BECAUSE IT’S A GOOD WAY TO GET ELECTRICITY AND YOU HAVE NO ENERGY YOU HAVE NO SMOKE IN THE AIR
I DON’T KNOW STILL
THE FLAME IS BURNING
THE GAS AND COAL ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT HAVE TO BURN THEM WHERE BECAUSE THE WIND TURBINE AND THE SOLAR PANEL THERE STORED ENERGY AND THE GASOLINE AND CHARCOAL ARE NOT SO THAT’S WHY THEY ARE DIFFERENT <SILENCE> <BREATH>
COAL AND GAS WILL POLLUTE THE AIR BECAUSE YOU HAVE BURN THEM
WHEN THEY USE A NON RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE IT BURNS UNTIL BURN OUT YOU WON’T HAVE A WHOLE LOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW BURN NOW AND ALSO IT POLLUTES THE AIR
IT SOUNDED LIKE A CRACKLING TYPE WAS SOUND
I SEE THAT THE CANDLE WAS BURNING AND THE WAX IS MELTING < SILENCE> <BREATH> OKAY
YEAH (8) BUT GLOW CRACKLES FROM THE LIGHT
WHAT THEY HAVING COME ON THESE THEY BOTH COLLECT ENERGY FROM THE WIND AND THE SUN AND THEY WILL STORE THE ENERGY THEY SO THEY ARE BOTH STORED ENERGY
A WOOD IS ONE AND <SIDE SPEAKER> WOOD AND WOOD
A BURNING CANDLE GIVES UP HEAT ENERGY
(*)
I DO NOT KNOW
BECAUSE SHE IS WALKING AND WHEN SHE WOULD EAT SHE IS S GETTING ENERGY FROM THE FOOD SO SHE CAN KEEP ON WALK
IT POLLUTES THE AIR THE AIR GETS ON DIRTY AND NOT GOOD TO YOU FOR TO BREATHE IT
UH HMM WHEN YOU PUTTING THE HANDS PART ON THE ZONE IT IS MAKING SOUND ENERGY
THERE ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE THEY BOTH COLLECT ENERGY STORING
COAL AND GAS THAT HAVE EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE IT WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR AND BE BAD FOR PEOPLE TO BREATH
GOOD
I WON’T BE VERY GOOD BECAUSE IT POLLUTES THE AIR
THE OBJECT THAT ARE INSULATORS THROUGH THE OBJECTS THAT WOULD NOT METAL PIECES BECAUSE THEY CAN’T CARRY ELECTRICITY
I NOTICED THAT THE CIRCUIT IS NOT WORKING AND THE FLAG ISN’T SPINNING BECAUSE THE MATERIAL USE TRYING TO BE USE DOES A CONDUCTOR IS NOT METAL IT IS THE STICK WHICH CAN’T CARRY WHICH IS NOT A CONDUCTOR
I’VE OBSERVED THAT REALLY THE THINGS THAT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY OR METAL ANY KIND OF METAL USUALLY
I NOTICED THAT ALL THE PIECE WILL ALL THE PIECES THAT WERE METAL WORK BUT THE PIECES THAT WON’T METAL DIDN’T WORK
THE GRAY
I NOTICED THAT IT HAD IT’S THE CIRCUIT CHOOSING THE SWITCH BUT THE SWITCH IN CLOSE SO MAY HAVE TO USE A CONDUCTOR WHICH IS RIGHT WHAT’S THE CONDUCTOR IS AND THIS IS THE NAIL THE CONDUCTOR WHICH IS THE NAIL IS GOING THROUGH IN ITS SEARCHING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SWITCH FOR IT TOOK COULD TROUBLE SHOOT BECAUSE YOU CAN TRAVEL THROUGH THAT KIND
THE CIRCUIT DOESN’T WORK BECAUSE IT WILL NOT CARRY THE ELECTRICITY
A CONDUCTOR A MATERIAL THAT ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW THROUGH TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT WORK
INSULATORS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE WAS THAT THE THING IS LIKE THE PLASTIC AROUND THE WIRES THAT HELPS
THE OBJECTS HAVE A INSULATORS DON’T WORKED AS CONDUCTOR
I OBSERVED HAPPENING THAT THOSE SWITCH ISN’T WORKED ISN’T CLOSE FOR TO WORK SO WHEN YOU PUT THE  SO IT WASN’T WORKING BUT WHEN YOU PUT THE PAPER CLIP IN THERE IT’S STARTED WORKING BECAUSE IT’S A CONDUCTOR
BYE
<SIDE SPEAKERS> THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING THROUGH IN THE BATTERY AND ITS GOING TO THROUGH THE SWITCH BUT THE SWITCH IS A CLOSE TO MAKE A GO THROUGH SO THEY HAVE A CONDUCTOR AS NAIL TO CONNECT TO THE METAL PIECE TO GO THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE OTHER WIRE DIDN’T WIRE TO MAKE MOTOR WHILE UPON THE KEEPS DOING SAFE THEY
WHEN THEY USE OFTEN METAL PIECES IN THE CIRCUIT IT WORKS THEY USUALLY LIKE WHEN YOU USE THE ROCK THE SPONGE THE ROCK IN THE WOODEN STICK AND DESTROY WON’T WORK BECAUSE IT’S NOT METAL BECAUSE METAL IS THE ONLY TYPE OF CONDUCTOR USUALLY
WHEN TESTED THE OBJECTS IT THE ONES THAT WERE METAL WERE JUST RIGHT AND THE METAL IN IT WAS IT WORKING BUT THE ONE THE ONE METAL WORK SO THAT HOW YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR MAKING TRYING TO TESTING THEM OUT WHAT YOU PUT THEM ONE ON THE PIECE OF WIRE AND THEN THE OTHER ON THE ONE SIDE OF THE SWITCH IF THE FLAGS ARE WORKING THAT MEAN THEY WORKS BUT IF THE FLAG DOESN’T STARTS MEAN THAT MEANS IT DOESN’T WORK AND IT IS NOT IN CONDUCTOR IT IS IN INSULATOR
THE CIRCULATOR WITHIN THE CIRCUIT WHAT THEY INSULATOR AND IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE THERE IS NOT METAL METAL IS THE ONLY TYPE OF MATERIAL THAT WILL ALLOW ELECTRICITY OF FLOW
THE CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYS METAL AND ELECTRICITY CAN ALWAYS FLOW THROUGH THEM
THE WIRE
I NOTICES THAT ALL THERE ARE OBJECTS THERE ALLOWING THE CIRCUITS IN ELECTRICITY OF FLOWING MAKE THE MOTOR ARE FLAG TURN IS THE METAL OBJECTS WHICH ARE THE CONDUCTOR
WE’VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLAR PANEL AND HOW WOULD THE SOLAR PANEL ON AND DOING BATTERY ENERGY AND STUFF
THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO CIRCULATE FOR THE BULB TO LIGHT
A CIRCUIT IS A CY- IS A CYCLE OF ELECTRICITY THAT LIGHTS UP A RECEIVER SUCH AS A LIGHT BULB
WELL WHEN YOU HAVE ONE D-CELL THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ENERGY BUT IF YOU HAVE TWO THERE IS ENOUGH ENERGY FOR BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS AND THEY WILL LIGHT UP REALLY BRIGHT
<SIDE_SPEECH> THE ONE WITH
MY OBSERVATIONS SHOW THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW BY GOING THROUGH THE RIGHT AREAS BY THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTING UP AND IT'S CIRCULATING THROUGH THE RIGHT AREAS AND NOT THE WRONG ONES
<SILENCE> THERE IS ONE PA- OR THERE ARE- THERE IS ONE PATHWAY IN A SERIES
THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THROUGH BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS
WHEN WE ADD MORE BULBS YOU NEED ONE MORE WIRE <SIDE_SPEECH>  <SILENCE>  <SIDE_SPEECH>
WHEN THE BULBS ARE LIT I NOTICE THAT IT'S EITHER BO- IS- I NOTICE THAT BOTH NEGATIVE SIDES OF THE BATTERY ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER OR BOTH POSITIVE SIDES SO IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE IT WON'T FLOW
WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THEM IS THAT WITHOUT ONE OF THOSE THE CIRCUIT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WORK SO EACH ONE OF THEM HAS ONE PART TO DO IN THIS
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF THINGS STICK TO MAGNET
WHEN I DID MY MOUSE I SAW THAT IT FLOWS THROUGH IT IN THE SIDE AND COMES RIGHT OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT WILL ALWAYS GO ROUND AND ROUND AND IT WILL NEVER GO OFF THE CIRCUIT
I THINK I’M GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
BYE MARNIE
(*) ELECTRICITY CIRCULATES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BY GOING THROUGH THE SIDE AND COMING OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT
IF  WE ADD ONE MORE LIGHT BULB IN THE S- ONCE AGAIN IF WE ADD ONE MORE LIGHT BULB IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT THE LIGHT BULBS WILL BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THEM
THE BLUE DOTS MOVING REPRESENTS THE ELECTRICITY AND SHOWING YOU THAT IT'S CIRCULATING
THIS CIRCUIT HAS PATHWAYS FOR ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH WITH THE WIRE
I DISCOVERED THAT IF YOU HAVE TWO POSITIVE SIDES OR TWO NEGATIVE SIDES TOGETHER IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY WON'T FLOW BUT IF YOU HAVE A POSITIVE AND A NEGATIVE SIDE CONNECTING TO EACH OTHER IT WILL WORK
I SEE THAT IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE LIGHT BULB IT WON'T WORK BUT IF YOU PUT IT BACK IT WILL AND ALSO THAT IF YOU HAVE ONE BATTERY FOR TWO LIGHT BULBS IT WON'T LIGHT AS BRIGHT BUT IF YOU HAVE TWO BATTERIES FOR TWO LIGHT BULBS IT WILL LIGHT EVEN REALLY BRIGHT
IF YOU ADD MORE BULBS THERE IS LESS ENERGY BECAUSE THE BULBS ARE TAKING UP TO- THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ENERGY BUT THAT IS TAKING MORE ENERGY FROM THE D-CELL BECAUSE IT NEEDS BECAUSE THERE IS MORE LIGHT BULBS SO MORE ENERGY ALSO IF YOU ADD ANOTHER D-CELL TO IT IT WILL LIGHT UP MORE BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ENERGY FOR THE
THE LIGHT WITH A LIGHT BULB WILL BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE THERE'S EVEN MORE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THEM SO THE MORE ELECTRICITY THE BRIGHTER THE BRIGHT BULB WILL BE
THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND GOING THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT'S GOING THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND OUT THE BOTTOM AND THEN THE SAME THING WITH THE SECOND LIGHT BULB IT'S COMING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE FIRST ONE GOING THROUGH THE SIDE THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND DOWN THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE WIRES ARE CARRYING IT INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BAT- OF THE D-CELL AND IT'S CIRCULATING BY COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND STARTING AGAIN
THE ELECTRICITY IN A CIRCUIT CIRCULATES IF THE CIRCUIT IS <SILENCE> CLOSED
IF WE ADD MORE LIGHT BULBS TO THE SERIES CIRCUIT IT WILL DO THE SAME EXACT THING IT JUST KEEPS CIRCULATING ROUND AND ROUND BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE PATHWAY NOT
THE MOVING BLUE DOTS CONNECT TO MY THINKING BY SHOWING THE PROOF THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS CIRCULATING BECAUSE IT'S NOT STOPPING ANYWHERE
THIS MA- THIS MAKES IT A CIRCUIT BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS CIRCULATING AND THE RECEIVER IS LIGHTING UP OR WORKING
BECAUSE THE TWO POSITIVE SIDES OF THE BATTERY ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER AND YOU NEED TO HAVE THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE NEED TO TOUCH EACH OTHER NOT BOTH POSITIVE AND POSITIVE TOGETHER OR NEGATIVE AND NEGATIVE
THAT TELLS ME THAT THE ELECTRICITY WHERE IT GOES IS UP INTO THE SIDE AND THROUGH- IT GOES THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND THEN BACK DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB
I THINK IF WOULD CONNECTED BOTH WIRES AT THE BASE OF  THE BULB THE ELECTRICITY WOULD RUN THROUGH THE BULB AND THEN IT WOULDN’T COME OUT THE BULB AND SO IT WOULDN’T LIGHTED UP BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE CIRCULATING IF IT’S NOT CIRCULATING THEN THE ELECTRICITY CAN KEEP GOING IN THE LIGHT BULB WHEN I WANT TO TURN ON
BYE
I NOTICED THAT WHEN YOU CONNECTED BOTH WIRES TO THE BOTTOM OF BULB IT DIDN’T LIGHT UP I DON’T THINK IT LIGHT UP BECAUSE WHEN BECAUSE BOTH THE ELECTRICITY IS BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING UP THE NEGATIVE SIDE IS GOING INTO THE BATTERY AND UPDATE BUT BECAUSE THERE IS NO BECAUSE BULB WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BIGGEST OF THE BULB THE ELECTRICITY IS JUST GOING THROUGH TO AND NOT COMING OUT SO CAN CIRCULATE BUT IT’S WORK
LIGHT BULB RELATING THAT THAT THE ENERGY GOES TO AND THEN THAT WHEN THE ENERGY GOES INTO IT GOES INTO THE FILAMENT EVEN IT REACHED UP WHEN THE FILAMENT GET HEATED UP IT MAKES A LIGHT BULB SHINE
THAT IS THE SIDE THAT IS POSITIVE ENERGY SO THE POSITIVE ENERGY GOES END AND THEN ONE AGAINST TO RED PART IT BECOMES NEGATIVE ENERGY
THAT MEANS THAT THAT’S WHAT RECEIVES THE ELECTRICITY IT DOES WHAT’S RECEIVES THE POWER COMING FROM THE BATTERY
THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELLING THROUGH THE MINUS SIDE OF THE BATTERY GOING THROUGH THE WIRE GOING AND IT’S GOING IN THAT THE LIGHT BULB GOING OVER AND UP AND OVER THE FILAMENT IN IT DOWN THROUGH THE WIRE AND THEN BACK INTO THE PLUS SIDE OF THE BATTERY
I NOTICED THAT WHEN Y CLIP IT SO
BLUE DOT THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
IT TELLS ME THAT THE MINUS SIDE IS THE ENERGY THERE WAS JUST BEEN CREATED AND WHEN IT GOES TO THE PLUS SIDE IT’S BEEN CREATED
THAT MEANS THAT IS THE SHH… NOT TO SOURCE BUT THAT IS THE THING THE ELECTRIC THAT BATTERY THAT THAT’S WHAT THE BATTERY THE ELECTRICITY AS COMING FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND IT GOES INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND IT CHARGES THE LIGHT BULB UP AND THEN WHEN THEY GET HOT IT WOULD HAVE LET HOT LIGHTER
CIRCUITS AND HOW TO TURN LIGHT BULB ON
THE D CELL PROVIDES THE POWER
ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE D CELL TOWARDS CONNECT THE POSITIVE SIDE
NEGATIVE SIDE
THAT MEANS THAT IT CAN LIGHT UP MAY ELSE
THE NEGATIVE SIDE
THAT IS IT HOLDS THE ENERGY AND THEN IT LETS IT OUT AND GOES INTO THE WIRE AND LETS THE LIGHT BULB WORK OUT
THAT MEANS IT IS THE CONNECTOR
AND THAT MEANS THAT THAT’S THE PATHWAY FOR ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH
ELECTRICITY
THE WIRES CREATE THE ELECTRICITY CITY THAT POWERS THE LIGHT BULB
THAT GOOD
IT’S A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A BATTERY
I WAS ABSENT I DON’T KNOW THAT
THE BATTERY IS WHAT SENDING THE POWER INTO THE WIRE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT TURN ON
(80) THE SIDE WHERE THE LITTLE NUB IS COMING OUT YOU JUST FLIP THE BATTERY AND THAT’S FLOW OF ELECTRICITY IS GOING IN A DIFFERENT PATHS BECAUSE IT’S GOING INTO THE NEGATIVES THE POSITIVE SIDE AND COMING UP THE NEGATIVE SIDE BECAUSE IT SWITCH TO
I NOTICED THAT BOTH WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND THAT ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY IS GOING TO THE BOTTOM AND THE OTHER AND THE ONE SIDE IS THAT WIRES IS GOING ONE SIDE OF THAT WIRE IS GOING THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER WOULD SIDE OF THE WIRE IS GOING TO DECIDE SO THAT MUST BE IN THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING UP AND INTO AND THEY WHEN IT COMES OUT IT GOES ON THE SIDE AND COMES OUT
IT LOOKS LIKE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE OF IT
IT SHOWS ME THAT THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THERE IS THE WIRE IS GOING INTO THE PLUS SIDE AND COMING OUT IT GOING INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND COMING UP TO NEGATIVE SIDE SO MAY BE THAT MEANS THAT THE YELLOW PART ON THIS PART ON THE BATTERY IS POSITIVE ENERGY AND THEN THE RED WIRE IS NEGATIVE ONE
I NOTICED THAT THE SETUP IS GOING GOOD BECAUSE IT’S COME THE BOTH THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THE WIRE THAT COMING UP THE NEGATIVE SIDE IS GOING THROUGH STRAIGHT THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB IN THAT THEY AND THEN THE WIRE THAT’S GOING INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE IS CONNECTED TO THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB
THE WIRE IS WHAT IS HOOK TO THE BATTERY TO MAKE ELECTRICITY GO INTO THE LIGHT BULB
STOP IT
THANKS
IT'S CONNECTING
THE WIRE WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET FOCUSES IT AND UM THAT KIND OF HELPS IT OTHERWISE IT KIND OF WOULD BE JUST IT WOULDN'T BE A VERY STRONG MAGNET IF IT WAS A MAGNET AT ALL
THE BATTERY HOLDER WELL ELECTROMAGNETS ARE ONLY ONLY BECOME TEMPORARY MAGNETS THEY'RE NOT PERMANENT ONES SO THEY HAVE TO PICK UP THEY HAVE TO USE ELECTRICITY TO UM ER GET TO GET THROUGH TO BE ABLE TO GET UM ON TO THE TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT THE WASHERS OTHERWI- SINCE THERE'RE JUST LIKE A NAIL UM OTHERWI- BUT THEY HAVE TO HAVE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH UM THE IN THE CIRCUIT SO THAT YOU CAN PUT THE WASHERS SO THAT YOU CAN TAKE THE WASHERS OUT WITH THE MAGNETISM
SWITCH UM UNCONNECTS UNCONNECTS IT SO THE ELECTROMAGNET CANNOT SO THE ELECTRICITY
IN THIS PICTURE YOU HAVE THE WIRES HOOKED UP TO THE BATTERY AND HOOKED UP TO THE SWITCH AND THEN YOU HAVE THE WIRE HOOKED UP TO THE BATTERY AND WRAPPED AROUND THE POLE AND THEN YOU HAVE IT UM HOOKED UP TO THE SWITCH AGAIN AND THE ELECTRICITY'S ON THE POLE
UM NO ALUMINUM WOULD PROBABLY NOT
THE WASH THE NA UM THE ELECTRICITY'S GETTING STRONGER AND IT'S ATTRACTING MORE AND MORE WASHERS
UM YEAH OTH- CAUSE WE TRIED THAT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND IT DIDN'T REALLY WORK OUT WELL <BREATH>
IT WON'T GO THROUGH I MEAN <LAUGH>
ELECTROMAGNETS YOU CAN TURN ON AND OFF UM BY A SWITCH AND THEN PER PERMANENT MAGNETS YOU CAN NEVER TURN ON AND OFF IT'S JUST IT'S ALWAYS ON
A LOTS LIKE IN A JUNKYARD IT WILL PICK UP CARS WITH A HUGE ELECTROMAGNET AND THEN WHEN IT NEEDS TO DROP THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE THEN THEY UN THEY LIKE UNCONNECT A SWITCH LIKE WE DID ON THIS PROJECT AND IT WILL UNDO
UM IT HELPED BECAUSE YOU REALIZED THAT THE ELECTRICITY WOULD FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES ONLY FROM ONE SIDE AND IF YOU HAD POSITIVE PA FACING POSITIVE IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A NEGATIVE FACING A POSITIVE
IT'S NOT WHAT JUST HAPPENED
YES
UM IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU NEED A BATTERY THAT'S ALWAYS GOING I MEAN A MAGNET THAT'S ALWAYS GOING <BREATH> BUT SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO TURN A BATTERY OFF
ER WE MAKE ELECTROMAGNETS BY UM WE TOOK UM THE ONE ISN'T THERE SUPPOSED TO BE ANOTHER WIRE
IF YOU WERE TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT'S BURIED UM UNDER SOMETHING AND IT WAS MADE OUT OF METAL IF YOU WERE TRYING TO FIND A WASHER FOR ONE OF THOSE OR IF IF YOU HAD A STRONG A LITTLE BIT OF STRONGER MAGNET <BREATH> BUT EVEN IF IT WAS LIKE THAT IF YOU ARE TRYING TO FIND A SMALL SMALL SMALL METAL THING THAT YOU UM LOST OR SOMETHING THEN YOU COULD USE THAT AND IT WOULD FIND IT UNDER WHEREVER IT WAS BURIED LIKE IN THE CARPET OR BURIED UNDER <BREATH>
IS OBJECTS
IT FITS IN BECAUSE IT WE DID THIS JUST THIS MORNING IN SCIENCE
GOOD
SMALL WASHERS WHATEVER THEY'RE CALLED
BYE
THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU DO THE MORE OF THE MORE PIECES GET PICKED UP
CAUSE IT'S FOCUSING IT MORE AND IT'S CAUSE WHEN WIRES WRAPPED AROUND A BAR IT WON'T REALLY GO THROUGH BUT IF THERE IS SOMETHING AROUND IT <BREATH> IT WILL BE FOCUSING IT SO THAT IT JUST STAYS IT WILL GO STRAIGHT THROUGH THAT PATH AND NOT HAVE NOT BE ABLE TO JUST GET AWAY FROM IT
UM SO IF YOU TAKE ONE WIRE AND WE CONNECT IT TO A BATTERY WHICH YOU PUT IN A BATTERY HOLDER UM AND THEN YOU WRAP THE WIRE AROUND AS TIGHTLY AS YOU CAN ER AROUND THE <BREATH> RIV- RIVET AND UM THEN YOU USE THE LITTLE WI- THEN YOU ER CO CONNECT IT TO THE CONNECT IT TO THE SWITCH AND THEN YOU USE THE OTHER WIRE TO CONNECT IT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SWITCH AND THE ER RI- RIVETS IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THAT AND THEN YOU TAKE THE WASHERS AND YOU PUT THEM IN A CUP AND THEN UM YOU CONNECT THE SWITCH AND YOU UM STICK IT INTO THE CUP WITH ALL THE WASHERS INSIDE OF IT AND YOU TRY TO COLLECT ALL THE WASHERS AND TRY TO GET THEM ALL OUT
POWER IS GOING TO TRAVEL THROUGH
THANKS FOR HAVING ME
UM THE ELECTRICITY'S STRONG BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF WIRE WRAPPED AROUND AND ALL FLOWING THROUGH THE POLE SO QUICKLY THAT IT TURNS HOT
BYE <BREATH>
MAYBE ELECTRICITY CARRIES WE DIDN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THIS BUT CAUSE IT KIND OF CARRY INTO UM DOES IT LIKE CARRY THROUGH THE WIRE OR DOES IT CARRY A LITTLE BIT OF MAGNETISM WELL IF IT'S ON A UH UH UH NAIL OBJECT THEN WOULD IT BE ABLE TO CARRY MAGNETISM THROUGH IT
MAGNET WILL BE STRONGER
THAT IS THE ELECTRICITY WOULD GO ON TO THE MET IRON POLE AND THEN IT HAS ELECTRICITY IN IT AND IT WILL PICK UP METAL
ER UNCONNECT <BREATH> IF SOMETHING IS CONNECTED AND THEN YOU TAKE IT APART <BREATH> LIKE WITH LEGOS IF THE TWO LEGOS ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER <BREATH> THEN AND YOU TAKE IT APART IT'S UNCONNECTING
THE ELECTRICITY'S FORCE IS PULLING UP THE WASHERS BECAUSE IT'S ATTRACTED TO THEM
NO THE WAY WE DID IT IS OUR SWITCH WAS TAKING A LITTLE BIT LONGER WELL YEAH YOU COULD
YES I DID
YOU COULD WRAP IT A LOT MORE AND UM YOU COULD THEN YOU CAN UM ER IF YOU WRAP IT A LOT MORE THEN IT WILL FOCUS IT MORE SO YOU'LL YOU CAN MAKE IT STRONGER BUT IF IT'S BARELY WRAPPED THEN IT'S JUST GOING TO BE VERY VERY VERY LIGHT OF IT
ER IS GET
THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM <BREATH> THE BATTERY
YES WE DID MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
CANNOT GET THROUGH TO THE ELECTROMAGNET UM IT'LL GO THROUGH
WASHERS
THE BATTERY IS FULL OF ELECTRICITY AND IT MAKES THINGS RUN SO IF YOU HOOK A WIRE UP TO IT THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO GO THROUGH THE WIRE AND TURN ON WHATEVER YOU WANT TO TURN ON
UM THE REASON IT GOT HOT WAS ALL THE ELECTRICITY WAS FLOWING THROUGH IT AND SO IT GOT SO STRONG THAT IT STARTED TO GET HOT
IT WOULDN'T WORK AS WELL IT WOULD BE LOTS AND LOTS LESS MAGNETISM BECAUSE IF YOU ONLY WRAPPED UP HALF OF IT <BREATH> IT'S GOING TO GO KIND OF OUT OF IT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE CARRYING THROUGH VERY WELL AND IT'S JUST GOING TO LIKE DROP ALL THE MAGNETS IT'S ONLY GOING TO CARRY A FEW
THAT THE ELECTRICITY WAS WAS FLOWING BECAUSE IT GOT HOT
WHAT WAS THE QUESTION
RIGHT
-OTOR IF THE MOTOR'S RUNNING UM AND IF THE WIRE'S AREN'T CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY IT ALSO WON'T RUN
AND THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE CIRCUIT BECAUSE IT COMES FROM THE BATTERY AND THEN IT COMES OUT THROUGH THE WIRES ONTO THE ON OFF SWITCH AND THEN ONTO THE TEMPLATE THAT THE LIGHT BULB'S O ON AND THEN IT TRAVELS UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND LIGHTS IT UP <BREATH> SORRY
MMM THE CIRCUIT IS A CIRCLE AND THE ENERGY WOULD FLOW IN A CIRCUIT WHICH MEANS THE ENERGY WOULD FLOW CONSTANTLY IN A CIRCLE THROUGH THE LIGHT BUL-
IF YOU WOULD PUT BOTH WIRES AT THE *BOTTOM* OF THE BUL-
RIGHT
BECAUSE IT'S FACING OUT AND NOT CONNECTED TO THE WIRE <BREATH> AND WHEN IT'S CONNECTED TO THE WIRE THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH INTO THE UM GREEN WIRE ONTO THE MOTOR BUT SINCE IT'S NOT UM S CLOSED IT THE ENERGY JUST STOPS AND IT CAN'T GO ANYWHERE SO IT CAN'T MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
WELL IF THE SWITCH IS IN THE WRONG PLACE THE MOTOR'S NOT GONNA RUN AND IF IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE THE MOTOR WILL RUN
UM ALSO IN SCIENCE WE HAVE TAKEN A UM <BREATH> OH WHAT DID WE DO I FOR
IT'S LIGHTING THE WIRE THAT'S INSIDE THE BULB TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
ELL YOU WOULDN'T USE THE MOTOR YOU WOULD TAKE THE MOTOR AWAY AND THEN PUT THE UM LIGHT BULB ON A LIGHT BULB CIRCUIT AND THAT COULD GO IN THE SPACE IN BETWEEN THE MOTOR AND THE L UM BATTERY AND SO THEN YOU WOULD TAKE THE WIRES AND ATTACH IT TO THE UM LIGHT BULBS UM CER- ROUND LITTLE PLACE THAT IT WOULD GO ON <BREATH> AND THEN IT WOULD TURN ON IF YOU HAD THE ON AND OFF SWITCH CORRECTLY
YOU WOULD ATTACH THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THE BATTERY WOULD MAKE IT RUN UM IN A CIRCLE
WE ATTACHED THE WIRES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THE OTHER WIRES TO THE ON AND OFF SWITCH
WELL THE LIGHT BULB'S IN THE LIGHT BULB CIRCUIT THING AND THE REASON IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP IS BECAUSE THE ON AND OFF SWITCH IS FACE IS OFF AND NOT ON
THE ON AND OFF SWITCH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE ON AND OFF SWITCH CONNECTED THE ENERGY'S JUST GONNA FLOW OFF THE END OR IT WOULD JUST STOP BUT THEN IF IT'S CONNECTED IT GOES BACK THROUGH THE WIRES AND ONTO THE MOTOR WHICH MAKES THE MOTOR RUN
NO YOU CAN'T PUT THE WIRES ANYWHERE ON THE BULB YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM AT THE BOTTOM BIT WHERE THE UM WHERE THE LITTLE <BREATH> CYLINDER THING IS OR ELSE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE WIRE'S CONNECTED SO THAT'S HOW IT WILL LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
WELL THERE WAS A PLASTIC BOARD THAT HAD DENTS IN IT WHERE THE BATTERY WOULD FIT IN AND THE MOTOR WOULD FIT IN AND THE ON AND OFF SWITCH WOULD FIT AND THEN THERE WERE OTHER HOLES THAT WE DIDN'T USE BUT WE KNEW WHERE THEY WENT BECAUSE THEY WOULD FIT
IT WOULD PROBABLY LIGHT IT BUT SINCE IT'S NOT EXACTLY TOUCHING TOUCHING UM YOU MIGHT HAVE A HARDER TIME TO LIGHT THE BULB
UM SO WE USED A MOTOR AND WE HOOKED IT UP TO A CIRCUIT BOARD AND THEN UM WE HAD WIRES AND WE HAD A M UM A MOTOR AND WE PUT THE MOTOR IN THE SPOT ON THE CIRCUIT BOARD AND THE BATTERY IN THE SPOT FOR THE BATTERY AND THEN UM WE ATTACHED THE WIRES THROUGH THE MOTOR AND THE UM ON AND OFF SWITCH AND THEN WE COULD TURN THE LIGHT BULB ON OR OFF
NO IT'S NOT IN THE RIGHT SPOT
WELL IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BATTERIES AND MAGNETISM AND SO WE'VE BEEN TESTING OUT HOW WE CAN USE A BATTERY TO LIGHT LIGHT BULBS
YES
ONE WIRE'S CONNECTED AT THE BOTTOM AND ONE WIRE'S CONNECTED AT THE SIDE
-EAH IT FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
-EAH
THAT MEANS THAT THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH THE ON AND OFF SWITCH AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE ON AND OFF SWITCH CONNECTED IT WON'T FLOW THROUGH
RIGHT
NOTICE THAT YOU CAN SEE THE WIRE THAT'S CONNECTED TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE BULB AND THEN IT CONNECTS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BULB <BREATH> AND THAT'S HOW IT LIGHTS IT
YES
WELL UM IF THE MAGNET CAN ATTRACT TO THE PAPER CLIP IT WILL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP SORT OF AND UM
THANK YOU
YES
YES
MAGNETIC FORCE IS STRONGER WHEN THINGS ARE CLOSER AND WEAKER WHEN THINGS ARE FARTHER AWAY
AND WHEN IT STAYS TO THE PAPER CLIP YOU CAN FEEL THE FORCE WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING THE PAPER CLIP AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE MAGNET'S THERE
THAT THE MAGNET CAN GO THROUGH THINGS THAT I NEVER KNEW IT COULD GO THROUGH
UM LIKE IF IT WAS CEMENT IT WOULDN'T GO THROUGH BECAUSE IT WAS TOO THICK AND THE MA UM MAGNETIC FIELD CAN GO THROUGH THE CEMENT BUT IT COULD GO THROUGH A VERY THIN PIECE OF PAPER OR CARDBOARD BECAUSE IT WAS THINNER AND IT WASN'T AS THICK
YES
BECAUSE UM A MAGNET'S ATTRACTED TO METAL AND STEEL
YES
YES I HAVE ENJOYED LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
THE NUMBER OF WASHERS WOULD GO DOWN BECAUSE OF THE WEIGHT BETW- WELL THE FORCE WAS GETTING WEAKER EACH TIME SO THE WEIGHT WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE AS MUCH
TODAY IN SCIENCE WE USED MAGNETS AND WE TAPED EM INSIDE A BOX TO UM MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE COULD SEE EM AND THEN WE USED METAL SUPPLIES TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHERE THE MAGNETS WERE
A MAGNET'S
YES WE DID THAT IN ANOTHER SCIENCE EXPERIMENT WHERE WE HAD A W UM MEASURING WAIT NO A SCALE <BREATH> AND WE PUT PLASTIC CUPS IN THERE AND THEN WE HAD A MAGNET IN ONE CUP AND A MAGNET UNDER THE CUP AND WE WOULD PUT PLASTIC CHIPS IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS AND WE HAD WASHERS PUT IN THE OTHER CUP AND WE S WOULD SEE HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK TO SEPARATE THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION
YES IT'S BECAUSE THE MAGNETS WANT TO STICK TOGETHER AND THEN IF THEY'RE FARTHER APART THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO S UM STICK TOGETHER AND THEN <FP> AS IF THEY WERE CLOSER LIKE IF YOU HAD THE BOX AND THE MAGNET WAS ON ONE OF THE SIDES AND YOU WERE ON THE TOP YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH FORCE OF MAGNETIC ATTRACTION <BREATH> BUT THEN IF YOU WERE ON THE SIDES AND THE MAGNET WAS ON THE SIDES YOU HAVE FORCE OF MAGNETIC ATTRACTION BETWEEN THEM
WELL A MAGNET HAS TWO DIFFERENT SIDES NORTH AND SOUTH AND A SOUTH AND A NORTH SIDE ATTRACT OR NORTH AND A SOUTH SIDE ATTRACT BUT A SOUTH AND A SOUTH SIDE REPEL AND A NORTH AND A NORTH SIDE REPEL BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME SIDE OF THE MAGNET AND THEY WON'T STICK BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME BUT DIFFERENT ONES WILL UM CAN UH STICK
WELL SINCE THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTED TO STEEL UM THEY WOULD STAND UP BECAUSE IT WAS GOING INTO THE MAGNETIC UM FIELD
YOU'RE WELCOME
SORT OF CAUSE OPPOSITE SIDES ATTRACT AND THE SAME SIDE REPEL AND SO IF UH I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT THIS IF THE UM
UM NO IT HAS TO BE KIND OF A THIN MATERIAL LIKE PAPER OR A VERY THIN CARDBOARD
UM WE BUILT A BOX AND WE PUT MAGNETS SOMEWHERE WHERE WE DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD FIND IT
THE TWO CUPS THE MAGNET IN THE CUP A IT ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET UNDER THE CUP <BREATH> AND SO THE OTHER CUP B IS JUST FLOATING IN THE AIR BECAUSE OF THE MAGNET IN A IT'S PULLING IT DOWN AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
THANK YOU
NO IT WILL NOT ATTRACT THE MAGNET
UP AND IF YOU DROP IN MORE WASHERS UM THE MAGNETIC FIELD THE MAGNET THE WASHERS WILL PULL DOWN UM HARDER THAN THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS AND THEY'LL CAUSE IT TO <BREATH> MAKE THE SCALE MOVE TOWAR- TOWARDS THE BOTTOM BY THE MAGNETS
NO
THANK YOU
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE LESS WASHERS BUT LESS THAN THE ONE BECAUSE THERE'S MORE WASHERS
UM PROBABLY MAYBE ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE HIGHER THAN THE THREE
YES
UM WELL WE TRADED BOXES WITH PEOPLE AND WE USED METAL SHAVINGS OR A COMPASS AND WE MOVED IT AROUND THE BOX AND THEN WE UM PUT IT WE WHEN WE FOUND WHERE WE THINK THE MAGNET MIGHT BE WE DREW IT ON THE PLACE WHERE THE ON THE BOX ON THE PAPER
THERE'S SOMETHING BY CLOSER THAN THE MAGNETS IT'LL POINT TO THAT INSTEAD OF THE MAGNET AND THAT'S WHAT WAS CONFUSING ME
THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION WAS HAPPENING
UM IT'S TELLING ME THAT WITH <FP> ZERO SPACERS IT WOULD GET UP TO NINETEEN WASHERS AND WITH ONE SPACER IT'D GET UP TO NINE WASH NINE WASHERS UM WITH THREE SPACE SPACERS IT *WOULD* GET GIVE <BREATH> UM WITH FOUR IT WOULD GET FIVE ALSO AND WITH FIVE SPACERS IT WOULD GET THREE
THE WASHERS WHEN YOU PUT THEM IN THE WEIGHT OF THE WASHERS IS TRYING TO BREAK THE FORCE OF MAGNETIC ATTRACTION <BREATH> BETWEEN A AND THE MAGNET AND SO THE MORE WASHERS YOU PUT IN THE ST THE WEAKER THE FORCE GETS
COULD TRAVEL THROUGH A PIECE OF PAPER AND SUPER MAGNETS CAN TRAVEL THROUGH YOUR HANDS AND SOMETIMES THEY COULD PROBABLY TRAVEL THROUGH UM CHIPS LIKE LITTLE PLASTIC CHIPS AND IT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TRAVEL THROUGH UM A TABLE IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TRAVEL THROUGH UM A DOOR OR LIKE A BENCH
FORCE
YOU'RE WELCOME
OKAY
RE WELCOME
YES WE DID DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN CLASS WE HAD A GRAPH AND WE WOULD HAVE TO PUT THE STICKERS WHERE OUR IT UM WHERE THE SPACERS THE PLASTIC CHIPS WERE BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS AND SO WHEN THERE WERE ZERO CHIPS IT TOOK LIKE NINETEEN UM WASHERS TO BREAK THE FORCE AND THEN IT WHEN THERE WAS ONE CHIP IT TOOK NINE AND THEN WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY IT TOOK FOR TWO AND THEN WHEN THERE WAS THREE IT TOOK FIVE AND WHEN IT WAS FOUR IT TOOK FIVE AND THEN WHEN THERE WAS FIVE IT TOOK THREE
OKAY
IF THE MAGNETS ARE NORTH AND SOUTH OR SOUTH AND NORTH THEY'LL BE UM ATTRACT BUT IF THEY'RE NORTH AND NORTH OR SOUTH AND SOUTH THEY'LL REPEL
RIGHT
THE THINGS THAT AT THAT THE MAGNET ATTRACTS TO HAVE TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN THEM AND A PLASTIC CHIP DOES NOT HAVE IRON OR STEEL
YEAH
UM THE MAGNET
UM SOMETIMES YOU COULD FEEL WHERE THEY ARE AND <FP> YOU WOULD USE DIFFERENT MATERIALS YOU COULD USE WASHERS AND PAPER CLIPS AND YOU WOULD F SOME HAVE A STRONGER THEY WOULD ATTAC- THEY WOULD HAVE A STRONGER FORCE AND SO THEN YOU WOULD KNOW WHERE THE MAGNET IS QUICKER AND SOME FORCES WERE WEAKER AND SO YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THE MAGNET WAS AS QUICKLY
OKIE DOKIE
WHEN IT THE METAL SHAVINGS FOUND THE MAGNET THEY WOULD STAND UP
UM THE COMPASS IS ATTRACTED TO THE SOUTH OR NORTH POLES AND IT'S USED TO MAGNETIC BUT TO IT'S IT'S MAGNETIC AND UM IT IT'S WHEN IT'S UM HOW DO I PUT THIS <BREATH> WHEN
YES A MAGNET'S
WAS USING THE COMPASS IT UM KIND OF TRICKED ME BECAUSE IT WOULD POINT TO THE ARROW BUT THERE'S A LOT OF METAL THINGS IN THE ROOM AND IT WAS REALLY POINTING TO SOMETHING METAL AND IT WASN'T POINTING TO THE UM MAGNETS
UM THE SHAVINGS WORKED BETTER THAN THE WASHER AND MAYBE A BIGGER CHUNK OF STEEL MAYBE OR SOMETHING LIKE MAYBE LIKE SAND <BREATH> OR
WELL SOME GROUPS USED A COMPASS AND THEY WOULD PUT IT ON AND THEN WHEREVER THE COMPASS POINTED THEY WOULD USE A MAGNET AND TRY TO FIND OUT WHERE THE OTHER MAGNETS WERE <BREATH> AND THEN OTHER GROUPS JUST TOOK THE MAGNETS AND S UM PUT THEM OVER THE BOXES OVER THE BOX IN DIFFERENT AREAS <BREATH> AND UM THEN ONCE THEY FOUND OUT THEY WOULD DRAW ON A PIECE OF PAPER
A PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IF IT'S STAYED TO THAT CERTAIN SPOT WHERE THE MAGNET WAS THEN YOU'D KNOW WHERE IT WAS <BREATH> YEAH
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
THEN
IT THE INFORMATION ON IT TELLS ME THAT THE SHORTER THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM THE MORE SWINGS IT MAKES
THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM AFFECTS THE NUMBER OF SWINGS BECAUSE THE LONGER THE PENDULUM THE LESS SWINGS IT MAKES THE SHORTER THE PENDULUM THE MORE SWINGS IT MAKES
ON THE Y AXIS IS THE NUMBER OF SWINGS THAT THE PENDULUM MADE I'M GUESSING IT'S IN FIFTEEN SECONDS BUT IT MAY NOT BE
YOU COULD TEST MY YOU COULD TEST YOUR PREDICTION IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT IT
THINK THAT THE TWENTY CENTIMETER SWING WOULD BE A TINY BIT LESS THAN THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETER
SO I COULD USE THIS GRAPH FOR PROJECTING LET'S FOR TEN THE PENDULUM COULD GET
THE NUMBER OF SWINGS GETS LOWER AND
SO MUCH LONGER THAN TWENTY CENTIMETERS AND IF YOU WANT TO GET
THE INFORMATION LISTED ON THE X AXIS IS THE PENDULUM LENGTH JUST THE PENDULUM LENGTH AND NOTHING ELSE ON THERE
CENTIMETERS
WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO IS YOU WOULD PUT IT IN THE WATER THEN PUT AS MANY PENNIES AS POSSIBLE ON IT DON'T COUNT THE ONE THAT MAKES IT SINK THOUGH
THEY'RE DEV THEY'RE DESIGNED TO SAVE PEOPLE FROM A SINKING SHIP THAT WELL A BIG SHIP THAT IS SINKING
THEY'RE BASICALLY PAPER CUPS CUT TO A CERTAIN SIZE SO THAT THEY WORK ALMOST LIKE BOATS EXCEPT THEY DON'T HAVE MOTORS ON THEM
<BREATH> UM IT WAS EASY BECAUSE ALL YOU DID WAS YOU GOT A DICTIONARY MEASURED UP TO WHERE YOU WANT THE HEIGHT TO BE THEN YOU DID IT YOU DIDN'T GET TO CHOOSE THE SIZE OF YOUR CUP SO I MEASURED UP TO FOUR CENTIMETERS BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE STABLE BUT IT WOULD HOLD A LOT AND
HOW HEAVY ARE THE PASSENGERS LET'S SAY YOU USED A QUARTER INSTEAD OF A PENNY THAT WOULD BE WAY HEAVY THAT WOULD BE HEAVIER AND IT WOULD HOLD LESS QUARTERS THAN PENNIES
IF THEY ARE LIKE TIDAL WAVES IN IT THE WATER IT WOULD JUST SINK RIGHT WHEN THE WAVE HIT IT
YO
LEARNING ABOUT VARIABLES AND MAKING PENDULUMS AND BOATS
BYE
MAKES ME THINK THAT YOU SHOULD PUT PENNIES IN NEATLY INSTEAD OF JUST NOT DOING ANY NEATNESS IN YOUR WORK WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS
TO SEE HOW MANY PENNIES IT COULD CARRY WITHOUT SINKING
YES YOU COULD PUT BUBBLE WRAP AROUND THE TOP AND IT AND A WEIGHT ON THE BOTTOM SO THEN THE BUBBLE WRAP WELL ON THE ON THE RIM OF THE BOAT ALL AROUND THE RIM OF THE BOAT THEN YOU COULD PUT A WEIGHT ON THE BOTTOM SO THAT IT DOESN'T TIP OVER THEN IT WOULD PROBABLY HOLD MORE PASSENGERS THAN UH JUST A PLAIN BOAT
ON THE LEFT BOAT THE PENNIES ARE ADDED ALL NEATLY SO THEY HOLD SO THEY HELD TWENTY THREE AND IT FOR THE ONE ON THE RIGHT THEY WERE THEY WEREN'T SPREAD EVENLY SO THEY ONLY HELD FIFTEEN
THE BOAT WOULDN'T STAY FLOATING IT WOULD JUST GO DOWN
WELL SO THE ONE ON THE FAR LEFT WOULD HOLD THE MOST OR WOULD IT BE THE ONE ON THE FAR RIGHT EXCEPT THE ONES IN THE MIDDLE ARE SKINNIER SO THAT THEY WON'T HOLD AS MUCH
HOW THE PENNIES WERE STACKED LET'S SAY A WAS STACKED REALLY SLOPPILY AND D WAS STACKED REALLY NICE
THE ONE THAT'S NOT EVENLY SPREAD WOULD HAVE JUST SUNK BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE WEIGHT ON ONE POINT IT HAD A LOT OF WEIGHT ON EACH POINT AND THEN FOR AND THEN FOR THE ONE THAT HELD TWENTY THREE IT WOULD HAVE IT HELD WAY MORE BECAUSE IT JUST DIDN'T SINK WHEN THE OTHER ONE DID BECAUSE IT HAD MORE WEIGHT BALANCED OUT
YES THE ONE ON THE FAR LEFT WOULD HOLD THE MOST BUT THE ONE ON THE FAR RIGHT I THINK IS THE SAME SIZE SO I J I JUST THINK THAT THE WIDER IT IS IT WOULD HAVE MORE SUPPORT FOR IT
YOU NEED TO SPREAD THEM EVENLY YOU CAN'T JUST PUT THEM IN RANDOMLY IF YOU PUT THEM IN RANDOMLY YOUR BOAT WILL TIP OVER TO ONE SIDE
THAT YOU HAD TO UM THAT YOU JUST HAD TO BUILD THAT YOU JUST HAD TO CUT PAPER TO MAKE THEM BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO FLOAT AND CARRY A LOT OF PASSENGERS
ONE OF THE BOATS COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY WIDE AND THE OTHERS AND THE FOUR AND A COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY SKINNY
HE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE WAS THE COLDEST WHICH ONE WAS IN THE MIDDLE AND WHICH ONE IS THE WARMEST
<BREATH> THE OTHER CUPS ARE FIFTEEN DE DEGREES CELSIUS FURTHER THAN CUP B SA AND THEY'RE TWENTY SO WE COULDN'T REALLY TELL WHICH ONE WAS MORE WHICH WAS HOT MORE HOT BECAU- WITH OUR FINGERS BECAUSE OUR FINGERS WERE WA WE COULDN'T DECIDE ON WHICH ONE WAS WARMER AND OR COLDER
YOU KNOW THE HIGHER THAT THE HIGHER THE NUMBER ON THE THERMOMETER THE HOT THE MORE HOT IT IS THE <FP> LOWER ON THE THERMOMETER IT'S THE MORE COLD IT IS
WE MIXED 'EM IN A DIFFERENT CUP AND THEN <FP> WE MEASURED HOW MUCH IT WAS HOW COLD <BREATH> AND IT WAS IT WAS PRETTY GOOD IT WORKS PRETTY WELL
WE'VE BEEN MEASURING THINGS AND LENGTH AND THEN WE WE WENT TO MASS AND THEN NOW WE'RE DOING CAPACITY
EACH OF THOSE ITEMS HAS A STANDARD UNIT THE THERMOMETER HAS DEGREES CELSIUS THE YAR- METER STICK IS A METER THE LITER BEAKER IS A LITER AND MASS IT AND IN MASS IT'S UM IN MASS IT IS GRAMS
OUR BODIES CAN SENSE HEAT AND COLD <FP> SO UM WE'RE A LITTLE BIT LIKE A THERMOMETER BECAUSE WE CAN TELL IF SOMETHING'S HOT AND WE CAN TELL IF SOMETHING'S COLD WE CAN TELL IF SOMETHING'S JUST RIGHT
<BREATH> ONE WAS COLD AND ANOTHER ONE WAS COLD ALSO AND THE LAST ONE WAS WARM
WE HAD THREE CUPS OF WATER AND WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE WAS THE COLDEST WHICH ONE WAS THE WARMEST AND WHICH ONE WAS IN THE MIDDLE
BECAUSE IT HAS A STANDARD
C STANDS FOR CELSIUS
TO FIGURE OUT THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
DEGREES CELSIUS IS THE STANDARD UNIT SO PEOPLE WILL KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALK WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IF YOU SAY MY CUP OF SO MY CUP OF WATER IS F UM IS FIFTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS
IT'S VERY COLD
BYE
WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW COLD IT WAS WOULD BE AND WHY AND WE HAD TO ESTIMATE HOW COLD IT WOULD BE IF WE MIXED <FP> COLD WATER AND WARM WATER TOGETHER
A THERMOMETER
GOOD
YOUR FINGER IS UM IF YOU KEEP USING THE SAME ONE AND YOU USE THE COLD ONE FIRST IF YOU DO TH B THEN WHICH IS PRETTY COLD RIGHT THERE YOU ARE GONNA GET MORE IT'S GONNA BE MORE COLD AND THEN IF YOU PUT IT IN C <FP> AND THEN A IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO TELL WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME BUT YOU CAN'T TELL REALLY
MAYBE SIX WASHERS
OH <BREATH> TODAY IN SCIENCE WE WERE LEARNING AM UM WE WERE LEARNING HOW M MAGNETISM WORKS AND YOU TOOK <FP> A BALANCE BASE AND <BREATH> A BALANCE ARM AND YOU PUT UM A MAGNET <FP> A MAGNET POST UNDER THE CUP AND THEN YOU PUT A MAGNET ON TOP OF THE CUP AND THEN WE PUT METAL WASHERS IN THE OTHER PLASTIC CUP <BREATH> AND ONCE WE FIGURED OUT HOW MANY METAL WASHERS COULD UM FIT INTO THE CUP BEFORE THE <BREATH> BEFORE THE WHAT'S IT CALLED WHAT'S IT CALLED MMM MMM <BREATH> BEFORE THE THE MAGNET BREAKS AND THEN WE TRIED IT WITH UM PLASTIC SPACERS IN BETWEEN A MAGNET <BREATH> AND THE UM PLASTIC CUP WHICH HAS A *MAGNET* IN IT AND WE SAW UM HOW MANY <BREATH> HOW MANY METAL WASHERS WE CAN GET IN BEFORE IT BROKE
<BREATH> PLASTIC YELLOW ROUND <LAUGH> THINGS UM WE COULD PUT IN BETWEEN BWE- AND THEN WE WE COMPARED THE WE COMPARED THE DIFFERENCES BE LIKE ONE WITH ZERO WE HAD SIXTEEN <BREATH> WITH ONE UM PLASTIC YELLOW THING IN THE MIDDLE WE HAD SEVEN AND THEN SIX AND THEN FOUR FOUR AND FOUR
YES IT DID
WE PUT EM IN THE CUP EITHER BY DROPPING THEM <BREATH> FAR OR WE DROPPED EM ON THE RIM OF THE CUP OR WE JUST SET THEM IN
AMOUNT OF WEIGHT BREAKS THE MAGNETIC WAVE <BREATH> AND WE FOUND OUT THAT MORE <BREATH> PLASTIC WHAT ARE THEY CALLED
UM IT SHOWED US THE WAY THAT MAGNET WORK IS THAT MMM THE MAGNETIC WAVE IS STRONG UNTIL WAIT <BREATH> UNTIL
UM WE WERE WE RE WE REPEATED TO PUT THE METAL WASHERS IN THE UM PLASTIC CUP THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE <BREATH> MAGNET IN IT AND UNTIL THE UM MAGNETIC WAVE BROKE
TIL A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WEIGHT <FP> WHAT'S THAT CALLED WHAT'S THAT CALLED
YEAH UM WE ACTUALLY DID <FP> THE TRICK IS TO PUT <BREATH> THE WASHERS ON THE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CUP UM ALL STACKED UP TOGETHER AND THEN YOU CAN GET MORE BEFORE THE THE UM MAGNETIC WAVE BREAKS
THE MAGNETIC WAVE IS STRONGER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MANY PLASTIC YELLOW THINGS IN BETWEEN
YES WE DID
THANK YOU
THE SWITCH IS WHAT YOU USE TO TURN THE ELECTROMAGNET ON AND OFF IF THE IF THE ME IF THE SWITCH IF THE PIECE OF METAL IS TOUCHING THE OTHER PIECE OF METAL THEN THE <BREATH> ELECTROMAGNET WON'T WORK IF IT IF IT IF IT DOESN'T CONNECT THEN THE ELECTROMAGNET WILL BE SHUT OFF
SWITCH TURNS THE ELECTROMAGNET ON AND OFF
OF THAT IS THE ELECTRIC THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE PIECE OF METAL WHICH MAKES IT A MAGNET AN ELECTROMAGNET
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TWO FULL POWERED D CELL BATTERIES IT HAS TWO FULL CHARGED D CELL BATTERIES IT HAS MORE ELECTRICITY STORE STORED INSIDE THEM THAN ONE
WELL TODAY WE HAD WE DID <BREATH> MAKING ELECTROMAGNETS SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE TWO MIXED TOGETHER BUT OTHER ALL IN THE OTHER TIMES WE USED JUST ELECTRICITY OR MAGNETISM
THE SWITCH IS CUTTING THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY BETWEEN THE NEGATIVE END AND THE POSITIVE END OF THE BATTERY WHICH THEN CAUSE YOU CAN'T ATTACH WELL YOU COULD DO IT ONE WAY WHERE YOU PUT THE WIRE ON THE POSITIVE END AND NEGATIVE END AND YOU CANNOT TURN IT OFF WITHOUT PULLING THE STUFF OFF
<BREATH> METAL CAN BE MAGNETIZED AS NORMALLY AS STEEL UM STEEL OR IRON I THINK
UM I WOULD THINK THAT IF IT HAD TWO BATTERIES MAYBE THAT WOULD MAKE THE MAGNET MORE POWERFUL
STEEL WASHERS BECAUSE THE UM THE SWITCH IS ON ARE ATTRACTED TO THE ELECTROMAGNET BUT WHEN IT TURNS OFF THE ELECTROMAGNET DOES NOT WORK AND THE STEEL WASHERS FALL
OH I SEE A SWITCH WIRES A BASE AND A STEEL RIVET AND WASHERS AND A D CELL BATTERY THOSE ARE THE TOOLS THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
WELL THE MORE WINDS THAT WE HAVE HAD THE MORE WASHERS THAT WE WOULD GET BECAUSE IF WE PUT IF WE PUT UM UM TEN WASHERS I MEAN I MEAN TEN WINDS THEN WE WOULD GET THREE WASH WASHERS SO EVERYTIME THAT YOU WIND IT THE NUMBER OF WASHERS THAT YOU GET KEEP GOING UP
YEP
ELECTROMAGNET ELEC- AN ELECTRIC MAGNET IS A MAGNET BUT YOU CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF AND IT'S NORMALLY MORE POWERFUL THAN A REGULAR MAGNET
BECAUSE IT HAS MORE ELECTRICITY IN THE WIRES SO IT CAN MAKE IT THE ELECTROMAGNET STRONGER
CAUSE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES SO IF IT GOES AROUND THE <BREATH> THE STEEL RIVET UM THEN A HUNDRED TIMES THEN IT'S MORE LIKELY TO HAVE UM IT'S IT HAS FIFTEEN WASHERS BUT IF I GO DOWN <BREATH> TO TO TEN WINDS I ONLY GET THREE WASHERS
BYE
GOOD
THE MORE WINDS IT HAS UM THE MORE ELECTRICIT- THE MORE THE ELECTROMAGNET THE MORE POWERFUL THE ELECTROMAGNET IS
YES
YOU COULD PUT IN A NAIL MAYBE A STAPLE <BREATH> ANYTHING THAT CAN BE MAGNETIZED THAT CAN BE PICKED UP BY A MAGNET
THE ELECTRICITY'S FLOWING FROM BOTH ENDS OF THE BATTERY THERE ONE END IS POSITIVE END WRAPPING AROUND THE <BREATH> STEEL RIVET WHICH THEN IS ATTACHING TO THE SWITCH AND THEN THE SWITCH IS ATTACHING TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE WIRE THAT ATTACHES TO THE SWITCH <BREATH> AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S SOMEBODY MIGHT BE HOLDING IT ABOUT TO PICKUP THE STEEL UM THE WASHERS
WELL FIRST YOU TAKE THE BATTERY YOU PUT IT IN THE ON THE BASE WHERE YOU IT HOLDS IT THEN YOU TAKE A WIRE YOU CONNECT IT TO THE SWITCH YOU TAKE ANOTHER WIRE AND YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE STEEL RIVET HAVE A LITTLE BIT EXTRA TO ATTACH TO THE OTHER END OF THE BASE FOR THE BATTERY AND THEN IF YOU WRAP IT NEAR THE TIP THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT HAS MORE ELECTRICITY POWER
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
WE MADE THE UM A MOTOR SPIN
BECAUSE THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET UM THROUGH TO THEM
BYE
WELL THE D CELL BATTERY IS F FLOWING THR- UM IS ATTACHED TO A METAL WHICH IS ATTACHED TO A WIRE WHICH THEN GOES TO A LIGHTBULB AND THE THE ONE LIGHTBULB TOUCHES ANOTHER LIGHTBULB AND THEN IT AND THEN THE N AND THEN ANOTHER WIRE GOES INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
THERE IS TWO D CELLS AND THE LIGHTBULBS ARE LIGHTING UP MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE ELECTRICITY POWER
WE'VE BEEN MAKING S THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT OR E THE LAST TIME THE LAST TIM WE HAD SCIENCE WE
ELECTRICAL S CURRENT WOULD GO IN A OPP IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY HA UM YOU HAVE TWO D CELLS INSTEAD OF ONE
MEAN THAT THE ELECTRICAL F CURRENT WOULD F FLOW THROUGH LEFT UH NO FLOW TO THE LEFT
YES WE HAVE
H HAVE TO BE TOUCHING OR ELSE THE OR ELSE THE LIGHTBULBS WILL NOT LIGHT UP
YES A LITTLE BIT
GOOD
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWICE THE AMOUNT OF POWER FROM THE D CELLS
OH THE UM THE LIGHTBULBS ARE LIT UP MORE THEN THE PREVIOUS PICTURE WITH ONE D CELL
WE HAVE MADE DIAGRAMS OF WHAT WE HAVE UM DONE IN CLASS
THE WAY THAT IT'S GOING OUT OF IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IT'S GOING INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
WELL THE D CELL WE HOOKED TWO WIRES UP TO THE D CELL THEN WE UM PUT THEM UP TO THE LIGHTBULB SO THAT THE ELECTRICITY COULD THROW FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHTBULB
YES
THAT THE ELECTRIC CURRENT HAVE A PLACE TO GO
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT ALL THE ALL THE BULBS WIRES AND THE BATTERY
A LITTLE BIT BUT WE ONLY HAD ONE LIGHTBULB
WELL IF YOU FLIPPED ONE IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE NEGATIVE AND NEGATIVE AND THEN THE TWO POSITIVES WOULD BE ON THE OUTSIDE
YOU'RE WELCOME
I'LL TRY TO
MOST RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN DOING ELECTRICITY AND MAG MAGNETISM
YES
WELL THE TWO D CELLS AT THE BOTTOM ARE HOOKED UP TO EACH OTHER AND THEN THERE ARE ATTACHED TO TWO LIGHTBULBS AND THEN THERE'S A WIRE IN THE MIDDLE
THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TO THE RIGHT
WELL I SEE THE THE ELECTRICS UM THE ELECTRIC FLOW UM GOING THROUGH THE LIGHTBULB AND THEN H GOING THROUGH THE METAL THE BOT- THE BASE OF THE LIGHTBULB AND THEN FLOWING THROUGH INTO ANOTHER LIGHTBULB AND AND A WIRE TOUCHES A NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
IN A LIGHT BULB
WILL THEY LIGHT UP AND
IT FLIPS TO THE OTHER SIDE LIKE THERE IS SO WORTHY AND IT KEEPS ON HERE LIKE THE BLUE THINGS MOVE LIKE DIFFERENT WAYS
THEY LIGHT- THEY HELP YOU GET LIKE
LIGHTS UP
<BREATH> SOURCE IS THE SAME THING
I'M NOT SURE
+UM+ IT IS GOING TO A LIGHT BULB
BUT THEY ARE SOME ARE GOING DIFFERENT WAY
<SILENCE> CAN YOU SAY THAT AGAIN
RIGHT
IT WILL LIKE
<SIDE_SPEECH> OKAY SEE YOU NEXT TIME
I DON'T
HOW YOU +UM+ HOW YOU GET
WIRES CARRY <BREATH> LIKE LITTLE WHITE PIECES
<BREATH> ENERGY
I'M NOT SURE
<BREATH> A LIGHT BULB WIRES- YEAH IT’S TWO WIRES YOU KNOW AND A BATTERY
YOU MEANS THAT +UM+ IT LIGHTS UP IN IF SOMETHING WITH THE WAY IT WAS STOP <BREATH> <SILENCE>
IT (*) <BREATH> <SILENCE> A BATTERY WIRES AND
THERE IS A BATTERY THERE IS A WIRE THERE IS TWO WIRES AND THERE IS A LIGHT BULB HERE IS BLUE STUFF LIKE CLEAN DOWN END
THREE <BREATH>
WILL NOT LIGHT UP
<SIDE_SPEECH> SURE
A MIXTURE
<NO_SIGNAL>
<NO_SIGNAL>
YOU IS FIRST WHY AND THEN TURNS TO ALLOW SO IT TURNS
I KNOWS THAT THEY ARE GOING <BREATH> JUST LIKE THE SAME ONE
WELL IT'S THE SAME THING
<BREATH> THEY +UM+ THEY HELP YOU LIKE A LOT THESE LIKE GOING ON LIKE A COMPUTER NEEDS A WIRE (*)
GOOD
THROUGH WIRES
<SILENCE>
<SIDE_SPEECH>
IT IS MOVING HIS HEAT ENERGY IT IS
IT WAS A SOUND BLEEDER DO IT FROM DRY IT WAS FIRERY
THE SOLAR PANEL IS THE ENERGY (*)
IT IS LIKE MOVING SO THAT WE CAN IT'S FIRERY
<NO_SIGNAL>
I AM SEE BLADE GAS BUBBLE AND A FLIER
IT IS MOVING BECAUSE IT FIRE AND IT THE WHITE STUFF IS LIKE LIQUID AND SORT OF FIRE IS VERY LIQUID
I DON’T KNOW
<NO_SIGNAL>
<COUGH>
I DON'T KNOW
BECAUSE I REALLY BE WANTED TO BREATH
I WILL SEE
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ELECTRICITY
<SILENCE>
NO I COULDN'T SEE NOTHING
I DON’T KNOW
<SILENCE>
IT IS SAVE OF ENERGY OF <SILENCE> THE YEAH
<SILENCE>
APPLE
IT GOES ON AND ON
<SIDE_SPEECH>
<SILENCE>
I DON'T KNOW
(*)
HE IS RIGHT
<SILENCE>
I SEE A CANAL IN FIRE ON IT IT'S LIKE GETTING THE STATE AS TRAFFIC IS GETTING LOWER AND THEN IT'S GETTING ENOUGH TO GET
YOU KNOW A WIRE ABLE WOULD RELAX UP AND GO
IT MELTS BECAUSE OF THE FIRE AND LIVE IN THE IT MELTS BECAUSE IT'S LIQUID
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT FOR ME
IT SOUNDS SO THAT OF THE ENERGY CAN MOVE
<SILENCE>
+HM+
TO GO
<NO_SIGNAL>
WELL IT IS SUNNY AND THEN THE FLAG IS START MOVING BECAUSE THE GREAT THING IT IS HELPED OUT TO THE WIRE AND THEN IT HELP UP TO THE FLAG
I DON'T KNOW
IT LIKE IT MOVES LIKE A ROUND IN A
<SILENCE>
<BREATH> IT IS IN CLOSED BECAUSE THE MOTOR IS- THE MOTOR MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
I DON'T KNOW
IT WAS FLAG IS MOVING LIKE A ROUND LIKE CIRCLE AND IT'S +AH+ IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THAT'S HOW +UM+ WE GET HERE <SIDE_SPEECH> <BREATH> <SILENCE>
THE FLAG STARTS MOVING
I NOTE DOWN
IT IS GETTING ENERGY
WELL THE FLAG IS MOVING BECAUSE THE WIRES HELPED OUT TO THE FLAG AND THEN THE BATTERY GETS THE BATTERY CAN GET ENERGY
IT HAS LIKE ENERGY AND SO IT'S TAKING ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
IT STOPS MOVING
IT MEANS THAT IS WORKING
IT'S OPEN
WHEN THE SWITCH HITS THE WIRE THE FLAG STARTS
ITS STOPS THE FLAG
WELL THERE IS A SWITCH BATTERY IS A FLAG AND THE SWITCH MAKES THE FLAG MOVE BECAUSE IT'S THE BATTERY THAT THE ENERGY IS COMING FROM
I DON'T KNOW
DON'T KNOW
WE HAVE BEEN I'M DOING LIKE IT MAKE LIKE LIGHTS GONE
WELL KIND OF CLOUDY DAY
SO BATTERY
I DON'T KNOW
THE SWITCH HAS TO CLICK THE WIRE AND IT WILL START THE FIRE WILL START
I DON'T KNOW
IT TURNS LIGHT WHEN YOU CLOSE TO THE SUN
WHEN THERE IS WALKING THE FLAG STOPS
IT IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY
THE FLAG STARTS MOVING AROUND AN AROUND
WELL THAT +UM+ CRAZY IS AND THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BATTERY
THE FLAG MOVES
YOU TELL
THE GREAT PIECE WHEN IT SUNNY
IT'S STARTS MOVING THE FLAG STARTS
I DON'T KNOW WE HAVEN'T DONE IT YET
WELL MAYBE BECAUSE THE SWITCH HITS THE WIRE AND THE WIRE GOES INTO
WELL WE NEED TO HIT THE SWITCH WHEN IT'S OUT IT GOES IN AND THE FLAG STARTS MOVING AND MOVING AND THEN IF IT CLICK IT AND THEN GO OUT THEN IT WILL STOP MOVING
OPEN
BECAUSE IT HAS SOME METAL
+MM+  <SILENCE>
<NO SIGNAL>
WHEN YOU ADD SOMETHING TO YOU LIKE THE BLACK OR ROCK IT LIKE WORK FROM LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO THE STEEL MESH OR THE STEEL NAIL OR PAPER FASTENER AND THE BASE RING I DON'T KNOW AND THEN THE (*) WILL WORK BUT LIKE THE BLACK ROCK THIS ONE THE ROCK THE STRAW THE PLASTIC AND THE OTHER NAIL DOES NOT
THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE NAIL AND IT'S TOUCHING THE WIRE AND THE FLAG IS MOVING THAT WAY
WE HAVE BEEN DOING CIRCUIT
<SILENCE> DON'T RUNNING FINE
<NO SIGNAL>
GOOD
THERE LIKE (*) THE FLAG TO OTHER ROUND BECAUSE
WE STOP
THE FLAG IS ONLY
THE WIRE
IN A SWITCH IT THE FLAG STARTS GOING AND WHEN YOU PRESS THE BLACK ROCK IT STOPS
IT IS NOT WORKING
WELL IT BREAK GRASS STREET THE PAPER FASTENER BUT THE STEEL NAIL STEEL MESH OF
THE SWITCH IN THE WIRE
IT IS THE FLAG IS NOT THING ROUND AND ROUND <SILENCE> IS NOW WORKING <SILENCE>
I <SILENCE> JUST SWITCH THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AROUND
IT STOPS WORKING BECAUSE THE IT DOESN'T WORK
<NO SIGNAL>
<NO SIGNAL>
I DON'T KNOW
THE STEEL MAGNET THE STEEL
IT IS USELESS STICK THAT IS NOT MOVING
NOTHING
<NO SIGNAL>
FIRST THEM ALL WIRES AND THE SWITCH
I DON'T ANYMORE CLOSE TO ANYMORE LEARNING IT
CLOSE
CLOSED
I SEE THE FLAG MOVING
YOU +AH+ OTHER INSULATED TO LIKE IT WILL STOP WORKING
YOU TOO BYE MONNY
<SILENCE>
<BREATH> IS NOT MOVING THROUGH THE STICK
IT STARTS RUNNING
OKAY SO THE PLASTIC
WELL THE SWITCH IS DOING IT BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT DOING IT BUT THE CORD THE WIRES ARE DOING IT BECAUSE THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND THEN MAY ALLOW IS HITTING THE SWITCH TO THE WIRE TO MAKE IT MAKE TO MAKE THE YELLOW BUTTON
GOOD MORNING
THE FLAG IS GOING AROUND AND AROUND AND IT'S COMING FROM THE BATTERY
WELL THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE WIRES SO THAT'S MAKING THE FLAG
IT IS THAT MOVING BECAUSE THE STICK IS NOT IS NOT A <SIDE_SPEECH> A METAL
WIRE
WE HAVE BEEN +HM+
THIS CIRCUIT IS <BREATH>
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM <BREATH> WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING MAGNETISM
GOOD
BOTH
THERE IS ONE MAGNET THAT IT STRAIGHT ONE IS CURT AND ONE IS A CIRCLE
I DON’T KNOW
IT WORKS
IT WILL-
<SILENCE>
BECAUSE THE OTHER NAIL DOESN’T HAVE IRON IN IT
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING MAGNETISM
<NO_SIGNAL>
WE
YES
IRON
(*)
WE HAVE OBSERVED GRASS- WE HAVE OBSERVED- WE HAVE OBSERVED <BREATH>
IRON
YEAH
THEY ARE STICKY BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR HAS
<BREATH> I DON’T KNOW
THE MAGN- THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING  +AH+ THE SCREW
+EH+ WHAT HAS IRON
THEY CONNECT TO ANYTHING THAT HAS IRON AND
WELL A TRASH CAN IT DOES BUT A GATE DOESN'T
SO ARE GRASS GROUND <BREATH> A LEAF A TREE DEAD GRASS DEAD LEAF ROCKS AND DEAD EARTH
IT STICKS TO IRON
IRON
IT STICKS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR HAS IRON
WELL THE MAGNET IS NOT STICKING TO IT BECAUSE IT- +AH+ IT DOESN’T HAVE IRON IN IT
<NO_SIGNAL>
IT DOESN'T WORK
SOME OF THEM WORK AND SOME OF THEM DON'T
BECAUSE IT DOESN’T HAVE IRON
WELL IT HAS IRON AND IRON IS LIKE MAGNETIC- IRON CONNECTS TO MAGNET AND SO THE REFRIGERATOR IS
WELL THE THREE MAGNETS ARE CONNECTING TO THE REFRIGERATOR
<BREATH> IRON
IRON
<SIDE_SPEECH>
IT STICKS TO A REFLIGE-REFRIGERATOR
BECAUSE ONE HAS IRON AND ONE DOESN’T
YES
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY <BREATH>
YES THAT IS CORRECT
WHEN IT IS OPEN IT DOES NOT PICK UP ELECTRICITY BUT WHEN IT IS CLOSED IT DOES PICK UP ELECTRICITY
IT IS WRAPPED AROUND NAIL CONNECTED TO A SWITCH AND A BATTERY TO MAKE IT UM AN ELECTROMAGNET SO THAT IT CAN PICK UP STUFF
THE MAGNET IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PUT ELECTRICITY WIRES AND A NAIL TOGETHER AND A SWITCH YOU ARE ABLE TO MAKE A ELECTROMAGNET
YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET <BREATH>
YES THAT IS CORRECT
THAT THE WIRE IS ROUND AROUND THE ELECTROMAGNET TO SO TO MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET SO THAT I CAN PICK UP THE WASHERS
THAT YOU WRAP IT AROUND AND YOU TURN ON A SWITCH
THE ELECTRICITY IS ABLE TO FLOW AND IT IS ABLE TO PICK UP UM <BREATH> WASHERS VERY EASILY
INSULATION MEANS LIKE THE COPPER WIRE IS INSIDE OF THE GREEN COATING
THE NAIL IS A REGULAR NAIL IF THE WIRE'S NOT WOUND AROUND IT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S ROUND WOUND AROUND IT IT ALLOWS THE ELECTRICITY TO GO THROUGH AND THEN IT BRUSHES UP ON THE N BRUSHES OFF ON THE NAIL SO THAT IT IS ABLE TO PICK UP UM <BREATH> WASHERS
YOU HAVE TO THINK OF HOW MANY TIMES YOU WRAP THE WIRE AROUND THE NAIL BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T WRAP AROUND THAT MUCH IT'S NO IT'S NOT THAT STRONG BUT WHEN YOU WRAP IT AROUND A TON IT'S REALLY STRONG AND PIC AND CAN PICK UP MORE
NO
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE RIVETS DOES STAYS BA- MAGNETIC
YES
THE WIRE ALLOWS THE ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH SO THAT IT MAKES THE ELECTROMAGNET
THAT YOU CONNECT IT TO THE BATTERY AND THE SWITCH AND WHEN YOU WANT TO PICK IT UP YOU BY THE SWITCH AND WHEN YOU WANT A AND THEN WHEN YOU WANT TO DROP IT YOU'LL NOT YOU DO NOT OPEN THE SWITCH YOU BY IT
THEY ARE <BREATH> THEY ARE STRONGER THAN A REGULAR MAGNET BECAUSE THERE'S ELECTRICITY INVOLVED AND ELECTRICITY ALWAYS MAKES SOMETHING MORE POWERFUL
I DON'T KNOW
UM <BREATH> I'M NOT SURE
<BREATH> WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS PUSHED IN THE UM WASHERS LIKE FLY UP INTO THE AIR AND TRY TO GET TO THE UM THE ELECTROMAGNET
WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT OR IT WON'T WORK <BREATH> IT HAS TO IT AND UM THE WIRES HAVE TO BE WRAPPED AROUND AND THEY HAVE TO BE SHUT
THAT MEANS THE ELECTRICITY WILL BE FLOWING THROUGH IT
WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN THE IT WON'T WORK BUT WHEN IT'S CLOSED THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW
<BREATH> THE WIRES ARE WRAPPED AROUND IT AND IS PICKING UP THE WASHERS
WHEN YOU HAVE ELECTRICITY WRAPPED AROUND AN IRON CORE IT UM MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD WHICH CAN PICK UP UM LIKE WASHERS
WELL IF IT'S AN OPEN SWITCH THE UM THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T FLOW <BREATH> SO THE UM THE CIRCUIT THE AND THE ELECTROMAGNET WON'T WORK
WELL AN ELECTROMAGNET IS UM LIKE SO YOU MAKE A CIRCUIT WITH A CORE AND UM <BREATH> AND THE ELECTRICITY WHEN IT GOES THROUGH IT IT UM MAKES AN ELECTRIC FIEL I MEAN A MAGNETIC FIELD AND
THE UM CORE WORKS LIKE A MAGNET AND CAN PICK UP THINGS LIKE UH WASHERS
I'M NOT SURE
UM WELL UH I'M NOT SURE
GOOD
<BREATH> IF THE UM S UM SWITCH IS CLOSED THEN IT WILL OP THEN THEY WILL PICK UP THE MAGNETS
WELL IT GO WHEN IT GOES AROUND THE CORE UM AND IT AND IT'S CLOSED IT MAKES AN ELECTRIC FI I MEAN IT MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD AND THAT CAN UH PICK UP L THINGS LIKE IN THIS CASE THE WASHERS
UM <BREATH> I DON'T KNOW
WELL WE'VE BEEN UH WORK LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETS
WELL WHEN YOU CLOSED THE CIRCUIT THE UM THE CORE BECOMES A MAGNET AND UH YOU CAN USE THAT MAGNET FOR TO UM PICK UP THINGS
WELL THE MORE YOU WRAP AROUND THE CORE THE UM THE STRONGER THE ELECTRI- THE UH MAGNET WILL BE
BYE
<BREATH> WELL THE WIRES HAVE TO BE ATTACHED TO THE UM CORE AND THOSE WILL AND THE MAGNETIC FIELD WILL PICK UP THE WASHERS
WELL THE CORE'S MAGNETIC FIELD GOES UM ALL AROUND IT <BREATH> SO THE MAGNETIC FIELD WANTS TO FOLLOW THE M UH WASHERS AWAY
UM WELL THE UM WIRES HAVE TO BE ATTACHED CORRECTLY TO THE UM THE UM THE BATTERY AND THE SWITCH AND THE SWITCH HAS TO BE UH ON IT AND IT HAS TO BE WRAPPED AROUND UM A LOT OF TIMES TO GET IT TO PULL UP A LOT OF WASHERS
WELL UM THE MORE YOU WRAP UM THE MORE YOU GET PICK THE MORE THE PI YOU GET THAT IT PICKS UP <BREATH>
WELL THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE GOING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT AND BE SOMEHOW GETTING TO A CORE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THAT CAN PICK UP THE UM THE WASHERS OR WHATEVER YOU WANNA PICK UP
UM WELL
<BREATH> UM THE SWITCH CLOSES THE CIRCUIT SO THAT UM THE ELECTROMAGNET WORKS
<BREATH> WELL IF THE SWITCH IS CONNECTED AND THE CIRCUIT IS GOING IT WILL PICK UP <BREATH> THE WASHERS
WELL SO YOU TA YOU MAKE YOUR CIRCUIT AND THEN YOU TAKE THE CORE AND WRAP WIRE AROUND IT <BREATH> A BUNCH AND THEN UM <BREATH> THE CORE WILL TR- HAVE MAKE A ELECTRIC FIELD I MEAN A MAGNETIC FIELD <BREATH> AND UM YOU CAN UH MAKE A MAGNET <BREATH>
WELL IT'S NOT QUITE AS BRIGHT WHEN YOU HAVE TWO BECAUSE THE BATTERY HAS TO POWER TWO AND UM WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE ONE IT'S ONLY WORKING ON POWERING ONE SO IT'LL BE BRIGHTER ON THAT ON THE ONLY ONE
WELL A CIRCUIT IS ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S UM MAKING SOMETHING WORK
UM IT'S GOING IN THE PLUS SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND FLOWING OUT THE MINUS SIDE OF THE BATTERY
UM THE BAT UM THE ELECTRICITY COMING OUT OF THE D CELL THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB
IT FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE THE MINUS SIDE AND COMES BACK IN THE PLUS SIDE THE POSITIVE SIDE
<BREATH> IT FLOWS TOWARD UM <BREATH> WELL IT FLOWS INTO THE PLUS *SIGN* UM THE PLUS SIDE AND GOES OUT THE MINUS SIDE
<BREATH> WELL IT ALWAYS FLOWS AWAY FROM THE PLUS SIDE <BREATH> SO YEAH <BREATH>
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WELL IF YOU HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS UM IT THE BATTERY TAKES IT TAKES MORE ELECTRICITY TO FOR EACH <FP> TO POWER TWO SO IT HAS TO SPREAD IT OUT EQUALLY AND THEN ON THE JUST ONE IT CAN IT DOESN'T NEED TO POWER TWO SO IT CAN JUST USE MORE ELECTRICITY ON THE ONE BATTERY I MEAN ONE LIGHT BULB
WELL IT'S IT UM IT DOESN'T TAKE AS MUCH ENERGY TO JUST POWER ONE LIGHT BULB THAN IT DOES TWO SO THAT ONE LIGHT BULB IS GONNA BE MORE I MEAN IT'S GONNA BE BRIGHTER
WELL <BREATH> THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING AROUND IN A CIRCLE THROUGH THE UM THROUGH THE WIRES TH IN INTO THE LIGHT BULBS AND THEN LIGHTING THE BULBS SO THAT AND THEN MAKING THEM GET LIT AND THEN IT KEEPS GOING IN A CIRCLE
UM SO THE <FP> ELECTRICITY *THROWS* THROUGH FLOWS THROUGH THE PATHWAY TO UM LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN FLOWS BACK INTO THE BATTERY THROUGH THE PATHWAY TO MAKE A CIRCUIT
WELL WE'VE BEEN UH WELL TODAY WE HAD FOUR WIRES UM AND TWO LIGHT BULBS THAT WE HAD TO LIGHT SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID TODAY
WELL ELECTRICITY IN A CIRCUIT IS GETTING MOVED AROUND THROUGH THE WIRES OR SOMETHING LIKE WIRES TO UH MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN
UM <BREATH> WELL JUST M MORE WI- ONE MORE WIRE AND ONE MORE UM LIGHT UM LIGHT BULB
I'M NOT SURE
UM <BREATH> I OBSERVED THAT THE UM <BREATH> THE ONE ON THE RIGHT UM NEEDS HAS A ONE MORE OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ONE MORE WIRE AND UM THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS ONE LESS WIRE AND ONE LESS LIGHT BULB THAN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
WELL IT HAS TO BE IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES FROM A A SOURCE OF POWER AND BE ATTACHED TO THE LIGHT BULB ON THE BOTTOM AND ON THE SIDE TO LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
<BREATH> IT UM <BREATH> IT ALWAYS FLOWS OUT THE MINUS SIDE AND ALWAYS COMES IN THE PLUS SIDE
BYE
WELL I THINK IT HAS TO TH FLOW THROUGH A SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY AND THEN FLOW TH AND THEN GO THROUGH SOME SOMETHING THAT WILL TAKE IT AND THEN GO UM THROUGH UH LIKE A BAT A LIGHT BULB OR SOMETHING THAT WILL USE THE ENERGY A THE ELETRI- ELECTRICITY TO DO SOMETHING AND THEN IT HAS TO GO THROUGH ANOTHER ONE TO MAKE IT A SERIES CIRCUIT
UM I'M NOT SURE
UM I JUST TOLD YOU BUT SO YOU JUST ASKED ME THE SAME QUESTION TWICE
WELL IT ALWAYS COMES IN THROUGH THE PLUS SIDE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
UM <BREATH> UM I THIN UM IT COMES IT GOES UH IT KO UM THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH UM <BREATH> THE SIDE AND THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ALWAYS MOVES IN THE SAME DIRECTION THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND UH POWERS THE
WELL IT'S GETTING LIT BY THE UH ELECTRICITY THAT'S COMING FROM THE D CELL AND FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES THAT AND THEN GETTING ATTACHED TO THE BATTERY AND LIGHTING IT
WELL E WELL IT'S ALWAYS COMING IN THROUGH THE PLUS SIDE INTO THE BA- INTO THE BATTERY AND THEN FLOWING OUT THROUGH THE MINUS SIDE
I THINK THAT'S SHOWING THAT UM THE WAY THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING
<BREATH> WELL IF YOU FLIP IT AROUND IT'LL STILL CA IT'LL SWITCH FRI- DIRECTIONS AND T BUT IT'LL STILL COME OUT THE MINUS SIDE AND GO IN THE PLUS SIDE
WELL <BREATH> IN THE ONE ON THE LEFT IT HAS <FP> TWO BA- TWO UM WIRES A D CELL AND ONE LIGHT BULB AND SO YOU TAKE AND THEN YOU HAVE TO ATTACH IT TO EACH SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND THEN ATTACH IT TO THE BOTTOM IN THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB AND UM ON THE TOP IT HAS THREE WIRES AND TWO UM UH T AND TWO LIGHT BULBS SO THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES IN AND THEN BE ATTACHED TO THE UM THE UH LIGHT BULB AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER WIRE THAT CONNECTS THE TWO LIGHT BULBS TOGETHER SO THE CIR- SO IT CAN BE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
WELL IT COMES OUT OF THE UH MINUS SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND UH COMES UP FLOWS THROUGH ONE LIGHT BULB GOES BACK DOWN THROUGH THE WIRE FLOWS INTO ANOTHER LIGHT BULB AND THEN COMES THROUGH THE OTHER WIRE BACK INTO THE BULB AND THEN GOES THROUGH AGAIN AND IT KEEPS GOING
WELL IT MAKES IT WORK BETTER OR WORSE IT DEPENDS ON WHICH WHAT TYPE OF CONDUCTOR IT IS
ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE METAL WOULD MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN BUT ALL THE THINGS THAT WEREN'T METAL UH WOULDN'T WOR WOULD UH PREVENT IT FROM WORKING
BYE
THE MOTOR WON'T WORK
<BREATH> WELL INSULATORS ARE THINGS LIKE PLASTIC WOOD AND THOSE TYPE OF THINGS THAT WILL PREVENT THE UH THE ELEC- THE CIRC- THE CIRCUIT FROM WORKING
WELL IF YOU HAVE AN INSULATOR THE MOTOR'S NOT GONNA WORK BUT IF YOU HAVE A CONDUCTOR THE UM MOTOR *WIS* RUN
WELL WHEN YOU ADD AN INSULATOR TO IT IT WILL JUST STOP WORKING
WELL INSULATORS ARE PRETTY MUCH THE OPPOSITE OF CONDUCTORS INS UM INSULATORS ARE THINGS THAT PREVENT CIRCUITS FROM WORKING CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS HELP THAT HELP IT WORK <BREATH>
WELL WELL THE NAIL ON THE RIGHT IS A STEEL NAIL AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS ALUMINUM AND S STEEL STICKS TO MAG MAGNETS BUT NOT ALUMINUM
WELL ALL THE METAL MATERIALS WILL MAKE IT SPIN
WELL IN THIS PICTURE YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF OBJECTS ON THE LEFT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TRY AND UM ON DURING IN THE PICTURE OF THE MOTOR MOVING YOU HAVE A SWITCH A BATTERY AND A MOTOR ALL ATTACHED BY WIRES
<BREATH> WELL THEY'RE ALL MADE OUT OF METAL OR ALUMINUM OR SOME TYPE OF METAL SO THAT SAYS THAT M METAL WILL UH BE A CONDUCTOR BUT NOT PLASTIC OR WOOD OR THINGS LIKE THAT
UM OPEN
<BREATH> WELL UM THE METALS THAT ATTRACT TO THE MAGNETS ALS UM ARE PRETTY GOOD UM CONDUCTORS TOO
WELL INSULATORS ARE ANYTHING THAT'S NOT METAL BECAUSE UM ELECTRICITY CAN'T FRA- TH FLOW THROUGH THEM SO IT WON'T WORK LIKE PLASTIC WON'T WORK WOOD WON'T WORK ROCKS WON'T WORK <BREATH>
<BREATH> WELL THOSE ARE STEEL AND UM IRON THEY WILL STICK TO AN A MAGNET AND CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
WELL SOME TYPES OF METALS STICK TO MAGNETS BUT NO UM <FP> PLASTIC WILL
WELL UM WE'VE BEEN UH WELL LAST TIME WE UM WE TOOK SOME UH WE TA HAD A BATTERY A MOTOR AND THESE TWO WIRES THAT WERE HOOKED UP UP TO THE BATTER THAT WERE HOOKED UP TO THE UM MOTOR AND THE BATTERY SO WE WENT AROUND THE ROOM TESTING IT ON OBJECTS SO WE'D LIKE PUT WE'D ATTACH THE WIRE TO BOTH THE WIRES TO AN OBJECT TO SEE IF THE ELECTRICITY WOULD COME THROUGH IT TO SEE IF IT WAS A CONDUCTOR UM A CONSUMER
GOOD
AN OPENS C WAIT <BREATH> AN OPEN CIRCUIT
WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES
ELEC- ELECTRICITY
WELL THE CONTACT POINTS ON THE BATTERY ARE BEING TOUCHED BY THE UM WIRES SO THAT'LL ALLOW IT TO UM THAT WILL ALLOW IT TO GET UM ELECTRICITY FROM THE D CELL LIGHT BULB INTO THE WIRES SO THE WIRES WILL CHARGE UP AND THEN THEY'LL GO AND THEN IF YOU ATTACH THEM TO THE LIGHT BULB ON THE CONTACT POINTS WHICH ARE AT THE BOTTOM AND ON THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB THAT'LL MAKE IT LIGHT UP AND THE CIRCUIT WILL THE CIRCUIT
WELL ELECTRICITY THROW FLOWS THROUGH THE UM WIRES BECAUSE THE CONTACT POINT IS LETTING IT OUT INTO THE WIRE AND THEN THOSE WIRES CAN LIKE TOUCH WELL DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A LIGHT BULB BUT LIGHT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE AND IT'LL POWER UP THE LIGHT
I'M NOT SURE WHAT CONTACT POINTS ARE
WELL THE ELECTRICITY STARTS AT THE LIGHT BULB GOES IN THROUGH THE WIRES UP TO THE I MEAN THE BAT IT STARTS IN THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND LIGHTS THE LIGHT BULB
WELL WE HAD A LATTER A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND TWO WIRES AND WE HAD TO MAKE A L AND WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE A LIGHT OUT OF IT
UM THEY'RE FOUND ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ON THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB WELL NOT ON THE SIDE OF THE BULB PART LIKE ON THE VERY BOTTOM AND THEN ON THE SIDE IS THE METAL PART
WELL
IT PRETTY MUCH GIVES IT THE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN SPIN AROUND THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
WELL WHAT HAPPENED IS YOU HA YOU HAD TO UM UM ATTACH THE BATTERY TO THE UM LIGHT BULB WITH THE WIRE SO THAT'S HOW SO THAT'S HOW IT WORKED
WELL THE CIRCUIT IS MAKING THE BULB LIGHT
<BREATH> UM YOU CONNECTED 'EM TO EACH CONTACT POINT AND THEN THAT POWERED IT UP
WELL THE WIRES LIKE HELP IT TO GUIDE IT THEY GO THE ELECTRICITY MOVES THROUGH THE WIRES SO IT GUIDES IT THROUGH
I'M NOT SURE I'M KIND OF STUPID
WELL YOU HAVE TO USE IT UM THE D CELL TO GET THE UH ENERGY TO LIGHT THE BULB
I'M NOT SURE
I'M NOT SURE
I THINK THE REASON IT'S UM SAYS SOURCE UNDER IT IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE SOURCE USED BY A LIGHT BULB
WELL THE LI THE BATTERY'S THE SOURCE IS UM MAKING ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH THE PATHWA- THE PATHWAY WHICH ARE THE WIRES AND IT'S GOING INTO THE RECEIVER THE LIGHT BULB AND IT'S MAKING LIGHT
GOOD
WELL THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE THINGS THAT YOU CAN STORE ELECTRICITY IN SO THAT UM YOU CAN USE THEM TO LIKE CHARGE THINGS
WELL A LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT UM YOU NEEDED LIGHT BULB TO PRETTY MUCH CREATE THE LIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S A MACHINE THAT IT USED TO L L LIGHT A LITTLE THING AND IT'S AND GETS THE LIGHT BULB LIT AND THAT'LL MAKE IT BRIGHT
WELL UH WELL UM YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE OF THE CORDS CONNECTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND ONE ON THE SIDE
WELL
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE ELECTRICITY WILL COME OUT IF YOU TOUCH LIKE RANDOM PLACES ON THE LIGHT BULB THAT THE ELECTRICITY WON'T COME OUT THERE
UM BECAUSE IT WILL UM THE CIRC- IT'LL BECAUSE THE CIRCUIT THERE'S LIKE TWO PARTS OF THE BATTERY PART OF IT WILL UM COLLECT THE UM THE ELECTRICITY AND PART OF IT WILL PUSH IT OUT
GOOD
WELL THEY'RE MADE FROM GOLD SO UM S AND GOLD'S A REALLY GOOD UM CONDUCTOR SO IT WILL WORK WELL
WELL GOLD IS A REALLY GOOD CONDUCTOR SO THAT HELPS IT THAT HELPS IT UM WORK
WELL THE WIRES ARE ATTACHED TO THE BRAD ON A AND THE BRA AND THE ONE ON D
WELL THAT SHOWS THAT UM THE WIRES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MYSTERY BOARD ARE CONNECTED FROM A AND C
WELL WELL UM THE WIRE CONNECT KEEPS THE CIRC- IT CONNECTS THE CIRCUIT SO THAT IT CAN RUN
WELL UM THE YOU HAVE TO ATTACH THEM TO THE BRADS SO THAT IT AND THEN THE WIRE IS ATTACHED TO TWO BRADS AND YOU HAVE TO FIND THOSE ONES AND THEN THAT WILL HELP IT WORK
WELL THAT'S THAT'S CONNECTING THE BRADS SO THAT IT WILL WORK
BYE
WELL THE THE UM WIRE IS ATTACHED TO A AND C SO THAT'S HOW THE UM SO THAT'S AND THEN YOU HAVE TO ATTACH THE WIRES TO THE THE A BRAD AND THE C BRAD SO THAT WILL WORK SO NOW THE CIRCUIT WILL WORK
WELL <BREATH> THE CIRCUIT YOU HAVE TO ATTACH 'EM TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THEN UM YOU HAVE ATTACH WIRES TO THAT AND THEN YOUR WI- THE WIRE ONE PART OF THE WIRE HAS TO BE ATTACHED TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE LI AND THEN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE WIRE HAS TO BE AND THEN THE PA THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE FROM THE BATTERY AND THE PART FROM THE LIGHT BULB HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE RIGHT BRADS WHICH IS ATTACHED TO A WIRE AND ONCE THOSE ARE ALL CONNECTED THE CIRCUIT WILL WORK
WELL WE HAD THIS CARDBOARD THING WE HAD THESE CAR THESE TWO PIECES OF CARDBOARD THAT WERE ATTACHED AND THEN WE HAD FOUR BRADS AND THERE WAS ONE THAT WAS A B C AND D AND WE HAD TO SEE WHICH ONES HAD THE WIRE THAT WAS UNDER THE BRADS CONNECTED TO S AND THAT THAT WOULD START THE MOTOR
WELL YOU HAVE TO ATTACH THE WIRES TO THE RIGHT BRADS THAT'S ATTACHED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MYSTERY BOARD BY A WIRE AND THAT WILL MAKE THE CIRCUIT RUN
WELL YOU HAVE TO TOUCH THE THE BRADS ON IT WITH THE PART THAT'S NOT COVERED UP WITH THE INSUL- IT'S THE INSULATING SO THAT WON'T SO THAT IT'S NOT BLOCKED
WELL UM THE WIRE THERE'S UM THE BRADS AND UM THE WIRE IF YOU ATTACH THE WIRES <BREATH> TO OF THEM <FP> IF YOU PRESS ON TWO OF THEM THE UM LIGHT WILL THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT UP
UM THE CONDUCTORS
A CLOSED CIRCUIT
WELL YOU HAVE TO FIND THE RIGHT UM TWO BRADS THAT THE WIRES ATTACHED TO OR THE CIRCUIT WON'T WORK
WELL UNDER THE MA ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MYSTERY BOARD YOU ATTACH IT TO THE BRADS AND THEN THERE'S A WIRE THAT ATTACHES THE BRADS AND THEN THAT WILL UM <FP> ATTACH THE CIRCUIT
WELL YOU COULD TRY TO ATTACH A TO B AND THEN YOU COULD DO A TO C AND THEN A TO D AND THEN YOU COULD DO B TO A B TO C B TO D AND THEN YOU COULD DO C TO A C TO B C TO D THEN YOU COULD DO D TO A D *THE* B D TO C
BYE
WELL THE STEEL NAIL GETS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE STEEL AND IRON STICK TO MAGNETS ALTHOUGH THE ALUMINIUM NAIL DOESN'T STICK BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON IN IT
YES
WELL UM MAGNETS STICK TO EACH OTHER ON IF LIKE IF A NORTH AND A SOUTH POLE SIDE COME TOGETHER THEY'LL STICK ALTHOUGH IF TWO NORTHS OR TWO SOUTHS COME TOGETHER THEY WILL REPEL OFF EACH OTHER AND NOT STICK OR NOT THEY'LL REPEL OFF EACH OTHER AND THEY WON'T COME TOGETHER
YES
WELL THE ONES THAT ARE NORTH AND SOUTH THE ONES THAT ARE OPPOSITE COME TOGETHER THE ONES THAT AREN'T OPPOSITE LIKE THE UM THE ONE THAT'S NORTH AND NORTH THEY'LL REPEL OFF EACH OTHER AND THE ONES THAT ARE SOUTH AND SOUTH REPEL OFF EACH OTHER BUT THE ONES THAT ARE SOUTH AND NORTH DON'T REPEL
WELL WE DID A LESSON TODAY THAT UM WE TESTED MAGNETS ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO SEE IF THEY WOULD STICK TO IT UM SOME EXAMPLES ARE THAT ROCK I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT AND UM A BUNCH OF STEEL THINGS LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND STEEL NAILS
WELL UM IF YOU PUT THEM ON THE WELL MAGNETS D BOTH SIDES ARE CALLED POLES THERE'S THE NORTH POLE SIDE AND THERE'S THE SOUTH POLE SIDE SO UM THE SOUTH AND THE NORTH POLE IF YOU HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OR YOU HAVE THE SOUTH POLE AND THE NORTH POLE TOGETHER THEY'LL STICK ALTHOUGH IF YOU HAVE LIKE TWO NORTH SAY THEY WILL LIKE REFLECT THEY DON'T WANT TO COME TOGETHER
OKAY
WELL MAGNETS STICK TO UM ANYTHING THAT HAS WELL ALMOST ANYTHING THAT HAS MAGNETS IF I MEAN THAT HAS UM IRON IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OF IT
HI MY NAME IS JONAH WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS
WELL IF YOU HAD A NORTH UM PO POLE THEN IT WOULD GO THEN IT WOULD ATTRACT THE SOUTH POLE IF YOU HAD A SOUTH POLE IT WOULD ATTRACT THE NORTH POLE
YES
HI MY NAME IS JONAH
WELL MAGNETS GET ATTRACTED TO IRON AND THERE'S THIS REALLY COOL ROCK THAT IT GETS GETS ATTRACTED TO IT'S CALLED MAGNETITE I I THINK I'M NOT QUITE SURE
YEAH I'M READY
IT WORKED
WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM IN SCIENCE AND HOW MAGNETS WORK
BYE
WELL YOU'RE PUTTING SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS SO IT'S STARTING TO BREAK THE FORCE
GROUP A GROUP B GROUP D THEY ALL GOT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME ANSWER EXCEPT GROUP C JUST KIND OF THREW THEIR WASHERS IN IN BAD ORDER
THEY'RE GETTING SPREAD APART
WELL IT MEANS MAGNETIC FORCE IS PRETTY STRONG
WELL THE MAGNETIC FORCE FORCE IS UM DECREASING BECAUSE IT'S GETTING PUSHED AWAY FROM EACH OTHER AND THE POLES CAN'T PUSH TOGETHER
<BREATH> IT BASICALLY JUST S UM IT MAKES IT SO THAT THE MAGNETIC FORCE ISN'T EX ISN'T AS STRONG AND IT WON'T KEEP THAT FORCE THERE BECAUSE THE MAGNETS I MEAN THEY WON'T STICK TOGETHER IF THEY'RE AS FAR AWAY OR THEY WON'T STICK AS HARD
WELL <BREATH> YOU WOULD WANT TO USE LIKE THE SAME WA THE SAME LIKE TYPE OF WASHER AND THEN YOU WOULD WANT TO PLACE 'EM VERY CAREFULLY IN THE SAME ORDER NOT ALL LIKE NOT DROP 'EM FROM TOO HIGH SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST LIKE THE FORCE OF IT FALLING THAT BREAKS THE MAGNETIC FORCE
THE MAGNETIC FORCE SLOWLY WEAKENS UNTIL IT'S NOT MAGNETI UNTIL IT DOESN'T STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
WELL WE FIGURED OUT THAT THE AMOUNT IF YOU HAVE TWO OF THE MAGNETS THEY THEY BA- THEY BALANCE EACH OTHER SO WE TRIED TO UM WE PUT DIFFERENT WASHERS IN THE B CUP T TO UM AND SEE HOW MANY WE COULD PUT WITH PUT ON THERE BEFORE IT BROKE THE FORCE THAT KEPT IT LEVEL
WELL WE'RE SEEING HOW MUCH THE SPACERS WOULD BREAK THE MAGNETIC FORCE BY SEEING PUTTING SPACERS IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS AND THEN TRYING PUTTING WASHERS IN IT SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS HAPPENING
GOOD
WELL WHAT WE LEARNED IS THAT THE MORE SPACERS YOU PUT IN THE LESS MAG I MEAN THE LESS WASHERS YOU COULD PUT IN WITHOUT THE MAGNETIC FORCE BREAKING
WELL UM WE UM DID THIS EXPERIMENT WHERE YOU HAD THESE WHERE YOU HAD THIS SCALE AND YOU HAD TWO MAGNETS AND THEN YOU HAD CUPS SO YOU WOULD PUT THE CUP ON THE SCALE AND THEN STICK ONE MAGNET ON THE TOP OF THE UH ON ONE SIDE OF THE UM SCALE AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE ANOTHER MAGNET AND YOU'D PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT SAME PART OF THE SCALE
WELL FIRST WE MADE THIS LITTLE GRAPH WHERE UM YOU'D HAVE LIKE A LINE IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN A LIKE ONE LINE GOING DOWN AND THEN ONE LINE GOING ACROSS SO IT'D MAKE LIKE A T KIND OF SO ON THE UPPER LEFT PART OF IT YOU'D WRITE NUMBER OF SPACERS AND ON THE RIGHT YOU'D WRITE NUMBER OF WASHERS AND THEN YOU'D NUMBER IT TO ABOUT TWENTY OR SOMETHING I THINK IT WAS I THINK IT WAS TWENTY AND UM THEN YOU WOULD UH DO THE EXPERIMENT AND YOU WOULD UM LIKE WRITE DOWN THE NUMBERS AND UH SEE WHICH ONES WHERE THE NUMBERS WOULD GO
WELL YOU NEED TO MAKE TWO SPACES ACTUALLY I'M NOT SURE
WELL THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS COMING FROM THE NORTH POLE MAGNETIC NORTH AND MAGNETIC SOUTH AND THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER AND THEY UM ATTRACT TOGETHER
WELL GROUP C UM PUT THEM IN NOT VERY CAREFULLY AND THEY ALL JUST LIKE WERE CRUNCHING AROUND AND THEY WERE DROPPING 'EM FROM HIGHER UP SO THAT MIGHT HAVE MADE IT WORSE AND BREAK THE FORCE JUST BECAUSE OF GRAVITY
THE DISTANCE INCREASES
WELL IF THE B CUP IF IT'S TOO HEAVY IN THE B CUP BECAUSE THERE IS SO MANY WASHERS IN IT THEN IT'LL BREAK THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS
UM IF YOU HAVE TO ADD MORE WASHERS I THINK THAT MEANS THAT THE MAGNETS ARE STRONGER IN OR IN OTHER WORDS THE MAGNETIC FORCE WILL BE STRONGER
<BREATH> BECAUSE ER NINETY AND ONE HUNDRED ARE BOTH FIFTEEN WRAPS
WELL TO MAKE IT STRONGER YOU SHOULD WRAP IT AROUND THE CORE MORE TIMES OR YOU SHOULD PUT MORE BATTERIES IN
<BREATH> UM IF YOU UN IF IT'S NOT AS WRAPPED AROUND AS MANY TIMES
WELL AN ELECTROMAGNET IS UM UM IT'S PRETTY MUCH A MAGNET CAUSE EL UM ELEC- UM SOME ELEC- ELECTRICITY HAS MAGNETIC FIELDS SO ELECTROMAGNET IS USING THE ER MAGNETIC FIELD FROM A EL EL UM FROM LIKE A ELECTRIC CIRCUIT TO AND USE THAT AS A MAGNET
STRONGER
BYE
WELL ONE WAY TO STRENGTHEN IT IS TO WRAP UM THE WINDS AROUND A LOT MORE TIMES
<BREATH> WELL THE MORE ER WRAPS THAT YOU DO THE ER HIGHER THE GRAPH GET UM BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WHERE THE WASHERS ARE
<BREATH> IT MEANS IT'S STRONGER
A CLOSED CIRCUIT
WELL ER THE MORE UM WIRE WRAPS YOU DO IT'S SHOWING THE MORE ER WASHERS
WELL THE UM THE MORE WINDS YOU DO THE STRONGER THE MAGNET IS AND THE MORE IT'LL PICK UP <BREATH>
GOOD
WELL THE MORE WRAPS YOU DO AROUND THE CORE THE MORE WASHERS YOU'LL PICK UP
<BREATH> UM THE NUMBER OF WASHERS JUST INC KEEP INCREASING THE MORE WASHERS YOU ER I MEAN THE MORE WINDS YOU PUT
ONE HUNDRED MI WI- WINDS MEANS IT'LL PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
WELL THE MORE WASHERS YOU PICK UP THAT MEANS THAT'S THE STRONGER IT IS AND THE WHEN ITS NOT AS STRONG YOU WON'T PICK UP AS MANY WASHERS
<BREATH> WELL THE MORE WIRE WRAPS YOU GET THE MORE WASHERS WASHERS YOU'LL PICK UP
<BREATH> UM THE WELL THE UM MORE WINDS YOU DO THE MORE WASHERS YOU WASHERS YOU'LL PICK UP AND THE LESS WINDS YOU DO THE LESS WASHERS YOU'LL PICK UP
<BREATH> THEY'RE ER INCREASING UM HOW MUCH UM PICK UP
WELL IT'S SHOWING THAT LIKE THE MORE ER WRAPS YOU DO THE ER MORE WASHERS IT'LL PICK UP
<BREATH> BECAUSE THE MORE UM IT'S TOUCH THE MORE IT'S BY TO ELECTRICITY THE ER <BREATH> THE BIGGER THE ELEC- UM THE MAGNETIC FIELD IT IS
<BREATH> ER YOU CAN WRAP IT AROUND MORE TIMES
THE MORE WINDS YOU HAVE THE MORE WASHERS IT'LL PICK UP
I'M NOT SURE
IT'S MAKING THE MAGNETIC FIELD BIGGER
UM THE FARTHER YOU GO TO THE RIGHT IT IT INCREASES TEN WRAPS AND IT'S GETTING HIGHER
WELL THE POWER FROM THE ER CIRCUIT ER TURNS IN ER THERE'S A ELECTROMAGNET FIELD AROUND IT AND YOU CAN USE THAT AND YOU CAN PUT IT LIKE AROUND A CORE TO MAKE A MAGNET <BREATH>
WELL ON THE BOTTOM IT SHOWS THE ER WIRE WRAPS SO THE FARTHER YOU GO TO THE RIGHT THAT'S THE MORE WRAPS YOU DO AND ON THE LEFT THAT'S NOT THAT'S MORE ER THAT'S THE MORE WASHERS YOU DO
UM THAT'S SHOWING THAT WE PUT ONE HUNDRED WINDS THEN IT'LL PICK UP FIFTEEN WASHERS
<BREATH> WELL THE STRENGTH OF THE ELECTRICITY THAT MAKES THE MAGNETIC FIELD THE STRONGER IT IS THE MORE WASHERS IT PICKS UP
WELL WHEN THE NUMBER OF WRAPS GET LARGER THE UM THE DATA THE UM WASH THE NUMBER OF WASHERS GOES UP <BREATH>
IRON OR STEEL
UM I'M NOT SURE
<BREATH> UM SOME OF THEM DROP BECAUSE IT WON'T PICK UP AS MANY <BREATH>
UM ABOUT FIFTEEN
WELL THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM REPRESENTS WHERE IT SAYS WIRE WRAPS THAT REPRESENTS ON THE BOTTOM THAT'S HOW MANY WIRE WRAPS THERE ARE THE NUMBERS ON THERE AND THE WASHERS MEANS THE HIGHER IT GOES UP THE UM MORE WASHERS IT'S PICKING UP
H <BREATH> UM IT HAS TO BE FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT AND HAS TO BE WRAPPED AROUND A CORE <BREATH>
UM THERE'S A MOTOR AT THE BOTTOM
WELL A D CELL GIVES THE UM GIVES THE ELECTRICITY FOR THE CIRCUIT
A LIGHT BULB
WELL A CELL OR A BATTERY UM MAKES IT HAS IT HAS ELECTRICITY AND UH IF YOU ATTACH WIRES TO IT IT'LL LET THE ELECTRICITY OUT AND YOU CAN UH USE THAT ELECTRICITY TO POWER SOMETHING UP
WELL ALL THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE RIGHT SPOTS AND THE BATTERY HAS TO STILL HAVE ELECTRICITY IN IT AND THE MOTOR HAS TO BE NOT WORKING
WELL UM A RECEIVER MEANS THAT YOU UH RECEIVE THE ELECTRICITY AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT LIKE IN LIKE THE MOTOR UM MAKES THE MAKES THE FLAG SPIN
WELL YOU HAVE A BATTERY WIRES A MOTOR A SWITCH AND A LIGHT BULB UM YOU HAVE TO ATTACH THE A WELL TO MAKE A CIRCUIT YOU HAVE TO ATTACH THE UM WIRES TO THE BATTERY AND HAVE THEM GOING AROUND SO THAT WOULD BE A SHORT CIRCUIT AND THEN WHEN YOU PUT SOMETHING IN IT LIKE A WHA- A MOTOR OR A UM BA- OR A LIGHT BULB IT UH US IT MAKES THOSE POWERED UP I
WELL THE UM BATTERY IS BEING ATTACHED TO THE MOTOR UM AND IT'S ALSO BEING ATTACHED TO THE SWITCH WHICH WILL POWER THE MOTOR
UM I'M NOT SURE
OH I'M NOT SURE
WELL THE MOTOR IS RUNNING SO IT'S SPINNING THE TOP PART WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THE FLAG SO THE FLAG'S SPINNING AROUND
LIGHT BULB THAT'S GETTING ATTACHED TO THE CONTACT POINT SO IT'S GETTING LIT
UM THE CIRCUIT UM UM IT UH GETS CUT OFF AND IT THEN IT STARTS UP UP AGAIN
<BREATH> UM THE MOTOR IS RECEIVING ELECTRICITY AND THAT IS MAKING THE FLAG SPIN AROUND
UM WHY DON'T YOU UM WELL THESE ARE JUST SUPPOSED TO SHOW THE CIRCUIT THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT BEFORE WHICH IS MAKING THE FLAG GO IS ACTUALLY UM
WELL PART OF IT SHOWS THAT WHERE THE BATTERY IS PART OF IT SHOWS WHERE THE SWI- PART OF IT SHOWS WHERE THE WIRES ARE THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULB WHICH LIGHTS THAT UP OR UH IS THAT A MOTOR I CAN'T QUITE UNDERST-
WELL THE BATTERY GIVES THE UM GIVES IT THE POWER TO AND THE ELECTRICITY TO MAKE THE MOTOR SPIN AND THE UM LIGHT BULB LIGHT
UM IT REPRESENTS A LIGHT BULB THAT'S GETTING LIT
WELL WHEN IT'S CLOSED THE ELECTRICITY CAN GET TO THE MOTOR AND THE CIRCUIT IS WORKING BUT WHEN IT'S OPEN THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T GET TO THE MOTOR AND THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
WELL THE WIRES UH TAKE TAKE THE ELECTRICITY AND UH YOU CAN CONNECT THEM TO SOMETHING SO THAT IT CAN MAKE A CIRCUIT
WELL YOU UM ATTACHED THE UM MO YOU ATTACHED THE UM THE WAIT
BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T TOUCHING THERE SO IT NEEDS TO BE TOUCHING BEFORE THE SWITCH WILL WORK
THAT'S A SWITCH
WELL WELL WHEN THE SWITCH IS UM CLOSED WHEN IT'S TOUCHING THE UM WIRE IT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN AND WHEN IT'S NOT THE MOTOR'S NOT SPINNING
BYE
WELL UM THERE'S A SWITCH IN IT NOW SO IF YOU PUSH THE SWITCH DOWN IT'LL TURN ON AND IF YOU TAKE IT OFF IT WON'T UM UH AA- IT WON'T MAKE THE MOTOR WORK
IT'S MAKING THE FLAG SPIN AROUND
WELL THE D CELL IS SENDING POWER THROUGH THE WIRES WHICH ARE TOUCHING THE UM THE CONTACT POINTS ON THE MOTOR WHICH IS MAKING THE MOTOR SPIN AND MAKING THE FLAG SPIN
WELL A MOTOR ONCE YOU UM USE THE BATTERY AND THE WIRES TO PUT ATTACH THEM TO THE UM THE MOTOR THE MOTOR WILL SPIN
GOOD
WE WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS GETTING USED IS GETTING UM IS SPINNING AROUND AND UH GETTING USED TO DO SOMETHING IN THIS CASE IT IS MAKING THE FLAG SPIN ON THE MOTOR
THE WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE D CELL
WELL TODAY WE DID THIS UM THIS THING WHERE UM YOU YOU HAD A BATTERY UM A WIRE AND A MOTOR
GOOD
WELL A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS A CIRCUIT WITH TWO WELL IT CAN BE TWO BUT UM AN EQUAL NUMBER OF WELL THINGS LIKE A LIGHT BULB OR A MOTOR SOMETHING THAT UH UM A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BATTERY IS POWERING AND THEY ARE BOTH ATTACHED TO THINGS THE SAME WAY SO YEAH
WELL THE BULB IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT ARE DIMMER THAN THE ONES IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
UH I'M NOT SURE
WELL EACH UM LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN UH PATHWAY FROM THE BATTERY
WELL UM THE UH TWO CLOSED PARALLEL LINES IN THE MIDDLE THAT MEANS A UH BATTERY AND THE CIRCLES WITH THE SWIRL ON IT THAT MEANS THE UH THAT'S THE LIGHT BULB AND UM THE STRAIGHT LINES ARE THE WIRES
AT BYE
WE'RE WORKING WITH ELECTRICITY
WELL THE PATHWAYS IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT SA UM ELECTRICITY *TH* THROWS FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB IT LIGHTS THE LIGHT BULB GOES BACK THROUGH ZIPS RIGHT BACK THROUGH THE OTHER L UM UM THE OTHER WIRE BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND KEEPS GOING AROUND LIKE THAT UNTIL YOU TAKE ONE OF THE WIRES OFF OR IF IT'S A SWITCHED UNPLUG A SWITCH
<BREATH> WELL TH ELECTRICITY ALWAYS THROW FLOWS THROUGH THE NEGA- OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND BACK IN THE N POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
TWO PATHWAYS I THINK
WELL THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO PATHWAYS TO GO THROUGH AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT ONLY HAS ONE
AND UH YEAH
THAT UM THERE'S MORE THAN ONE IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE PA
WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS
WELL UM THAT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
YEAH EACH COMPONENT HAS THEIR OWN PATHWAY AND THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTED TO THE SAME SIDE OR THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTED EXACTLY THE SAME
WELL ON THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS ALL HOOKED UP TOGETHE- EVERYTHING IS ALL HOOKED UP TOGETHER IN THE PARALLEL ONE IT'S KINDA LIKE TWO CIRCUITS JUST POWERED BY ONE THING
<BREATH> EACH WA EACH UM LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY
THIS REPRESENTS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
IT'S A WAY OF SHOWING A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
A PARALLEL CIRCUIT MEANS THE CIRCUIT ARE EXA- THE CIRCUITS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AND THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED TOGETHER THEY HAVE THEIR OWN DIFFERENT PATHWAYS
<BREATH> WELL IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE PARALLEL LINES UM THAT'S THE BATTERY AND THEN AND THEN THE AND THEN THE ENDS OF THE BATTERY TOUCH THE VERY TOP WHICH IS A WIRE UP THERE AND THEN ANOTHER WIRE THAT'S ATTACHED IN EACH BA- AND EACH WIRES ARE ATTACHED TO THE UM THE UH LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE OTHER WIRE TAKES IT BACK IN THE BATTERY
WELL ELECTRICITY *THROWS* FLOWS INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
WELL SINCE THEY SINCE THE ONE ON THE THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS ITS BOTH OF ITS OWN PATHWAYS IT UM IT ONLY HAS TO EACH PATHWAY ONLY POWERS ONE LIGHT BULB RATHER THAN THE SERIES CIRCUIT WHICH POWERS TWO
UM WE'VE BEEN MAKING S UH THIS CIRCUIT IT IS ONE BATTERY AND IT'S POWERING TWO LIGHT BULBS AT ONCE
UM THE PAPER CLIP IS LIKE SPINNING AROUND AS YOU DO IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS MOVING
WELL THE MAGNETISM MAGNETISM IS UH LIKE WHAT THE FILINGS ARE GETTING PULLED TO
WELL THE PAPER CLIP IS LIKE SPINNING AROUND AS YOU WELL WHEN YOU'RE MOVING IT IT'S LIKE FORMING DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS IT'S LIKE MOVING AROUND AND D LIKE SPINNING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SO THAT MEANS THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS MAKING IT MOVE THAT WAY
WELL IRON IS ATTRACTED TO THE WELL TH UM THE IRON IN THE MAGNET MAKES IT UM ATTRACTED TO THE UM THE UH THE IRON IN THE OTHER MATERIALS
WELL WELL UM THE PAPER CLIP IS WORKS REALLY WELL BECAUSE IT WILL UM BECAUSE UM THE PAPER CLIP IS HAS IRON IN IT SO IT A GETS ATTRACTED BY THE MAGNET SO IT GETS PULLED TO IT
WELL LAST TIME WHAT WE TRIED IN SCIENCE UM WELL WE HAD THIS BOX JUST LIKE A CARDBOARD BOX AND YOU WOULD TAPE A MAGNET SOMEWHERE IN THE BOX AND THEN YOU'D GIVE IT TO A DIFFERENT GROUP AND THEY'D TRY TO FIND THE MAGNET AND THEY HAD FOUR MATERIALS THEY HAD A DIFFERENT MAGNET THEY HAD A COMPASS THEY HAD UM LIKE LITTLE SCRAPS OF IRON AND
WELL THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS PULLING THEM TOWARDS IT AND THEN THEY'RE STANDING UP BECAUSE OF THE UM MAGNETIC FIELD THE WAY IT'S GOING
<BREATH> WELL THE PAPER CLIP WAS LIKE STICKING TO IT WAS LIKE MOVING AROUND IT WAS JUST COMING TO IT LIKE WHEN I DROPPED IT DOWN IT WOULD FLY OVER TO THE MAGNET
UM THE UM I'M THE MAGNET WAS BE WAS IN THE UPPER LEFT CORNER BECAUSE THE IRON LIKE THE IRON SHAVINGS WERE LIKE FORMING THE MAGNET SHAPE WHERE THE MAGNET WAS
WELL WHAT THE CASE IS WITH THE PAPER CLIP AND THE IRON FILINGS IS THAT IRON AT IS ATTRACT A UM IRON MAGNETS ATTRACT IRON SO IRON UM STICKS TO MAGNETS IT ALSO STICKS TO COBALT AND NICKEL ALTHOUGH THE ONE WE'RE USING IS IRON
WELL WHEN YOU GET BY TO THE MAGNET IT'LL START POINTING REAL HARD THEN WHEN YOU MOVE IT AROUND IT IT'LL START SPINNING AT IT SO THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S WHERE THE MAGNET
BYE
WELL UM THERE'S A MAGNET SOMEWHERE IN THE BOX AND YOU HAVE TO FIND IT
GOOD
I'M NOT SURE
IT UM IT STARTS LIKE FLYING TOWARDS WHERE THE MAGNET IS CAUSE IT'S LIKE JUST ABOVE THE LEFT CORNER THE LEFT LOWER CORNER SO IT FLIES UP THERE AND ST WANTS TO STICK TO THE MAGNET
WELL THE MAGNET IS GETTING ATTRACTED WELL THE PAPER CLIP IS GETTING ATTRACTED TO WHERE THE MAGNET IS BECAUSE IT'S UH MAGNETIC MATERIAL SO IT'LL COME TO IT
WELL THERE'S A HUGE MAGNETIC POLE IN THE EARTH SO THE UM SO THE MAGNET WILL ALWAYS POINT MAGNETIC NORTH UNLESS YOU'RE HOLDING A MAGNET LIKE REALLY BY TO IT BECAUSE THE POINTER ON THE MAGNET IS ACTUALLY MAGNET TOO SO IT'LL ALWAYS POINT NORTH UNLESS YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT MAGNET ATTRACTING SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE THERE'S A HUGE UM POLE IN THE EARTH
THE PAPER CLIP FLIES TO WHERE THE MAGNET IS BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS PUSHIN- IS PULLING IT IN
WELL THAT JUST SHOWS THAT THE MAGNET IS MAGNETIC WELL THAT THE COMPASS IS MAGNETIC SEEING THAT IT'LL ALWAYS UM SPIN AROUND AND UM IT'LL ALSO SHOW THAT OPPOSITES ATTRACT THERE
WELL WHAT ATTRACTS THE MAGNET I THINK IS UM IRON COBALT AND NICKEL THOSE ARE THE THREE BIG ONES BUT IN UM IN STEEL SO THE PAPER CLIP'S MADE OUT OF STEEL WHICH HAS IRON IN IT SO UM
UM YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MAGNET IS IN IT THERE'S PROBABLY A MAGNET IN IT
UH I SEE WHERE THE MAGNET IS IT'S IN THE LOWER LEFT UM CORNER
A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
FOUR HUNDRED
<BREATH> WE HAD OUR SYRINGE THEN UM THEN UM WE POURED IT IN IT HA IT FILLED UP TO FIFTY LIKE I TOLD YOU AND THEN WE POURED IT IN TWICE AND THEN IT GOT TO A HUNDRED EXACTLY THEN WE POURED THEN WE POURED IT INTO A BIG CONTAINER AND THEN EVERYBODY POURED ONE IN WELL S THE TEACHER SAID SINCE THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH KIDS WE HAD TO MAKE MORE AND UNTIL WE GOT TEN OF <FP> UNTIL WE GOT TEN OF A HUNDRED UM THAT WAS A LITER <BREATH> TEN LITERS IS
WELL A LITER IS BIGGER THAN A MILLILITER WELL LET'S SEE A MILLILITER IS
WELL UM SODA CANS AREN'T FILLED ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
UM YEAH WE WERE LOOKING FOR FOR UM THE VOLUME AS I TOLD YOU BUT UM WHAT WAS THE OTHER THING
YEP
AND UM <BREATH> AND WE FIGURED THAT HA IT HOLDE WHEN WE DRANK A SODA UM <BREATH> WE DRANK THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE WHAT'S IT CALLED MILLIME- MILLIMETERS
HMM LET'S SEE I DON'T REALLY KNOW LIKE MMM
UM WE USED GRAMS
YEP <BREATH> UH-HUH
MMM NO
YEAH
GRADUATED CYLINDER AND SOMETHING THAT *SOAKS* UP WATER IT'S CALLED A SYRINGE YEAH SYRINGE WE USED IT SO
UM YO
YEAH
YEAH CAPACITY <BREATH> THE CAPACITY IS WHEN UM I KNOW WHAT CAPACITY MEANS <BREATH> IT IS WHEN IT'S NOT FILLED ALL THE WAY UP BUT
LET'S SEE UM
NO
A LITER IS UM TWO A HUNDRED A HUNDRED MILLIM- MILLILITERS
NO WE PUT EM IN THE SODA CAN AND THEN WE MEASURED IT
YEAH
UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW WE DID A TALK ABOUT THAT
AND
YEAH
WELL WE USED A UM S WHAT'S IT CALLED AGAIN THE S SYRINGE AND E THE SYRINGE HOLDS SOME PEOPLE'S WERE SMALLER AND SOME PEOPLE'S <BREATH> WERE BIGGER BUT THEY HOLDED THE SAME WATER AND IT WAS AB IT WAS TWO FIFTY FIFTY *MILLILITERS* AND WE POUR IT IN <BREATH> THEN WE COUNTED BY FIFTIES UNTIL WE GOT TO FOUR HUNDRED <BREATH>
YEP
A LITER
HMM I DON'T THINK SO
<BREATH> WELL YOU MEASURED IT WELL WE HAD A BUNCH OF WATER AND WE PUT IT IN THE WATER AND THEN WE FILLED IT UP TO A HUNDRED UM HUNDRED AND THEN UM MILLIMETERS YUP MILLILITERS MILLIMETERS AND THEN UM WE KEPT FILLING IT UNTIL WE GOT UNTIL IT WAS FILLED AND SOME PEOPLE GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS LIKE WE GOT FOUR HUNDRED UM WHAT ELSE OH FOUR HUNDRED AND SOME PEOPLE GOT THREE HUNDRED <BREATH> SEVENTY FIVE
UM LET'S SEE
THEN WE POURED IT IN INTO THE INTO THE SODA CAN
WELL <BREATH> WE HAD OUR SYRINGE AGAIN THEN UM THEN UM WHAT'S IT CALLED
A THOUSAND
NOT REALLY
HE UH-HUH UH-HUH AND THEN WE FILLED IT UP INTO <BREATH> AND THEN AND THEN EVERYBODY UM B MEASURED EM WHEN ONE OF OUR CLASSES WE MEASURED <BREATH> WE FIGURED OUT HOW MUCH A MILLILITER WAS AND THEN WE POURED IT IN AND THEN OUR TEACHER SAID UM PUT WE HAD A BIG CAN WE HAD A BIG UM BOTTLE LIKE THAT ONE AND WE POURED IT IN <BREATH> AND THEN UM AND THEN UM WE NEEDED TEN
UM IT WAS ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP AND PRETTY MUCH YEAH IT WAS ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
YEAH
SINCE IT TELLS US HOW MUCH SOMETHING IS OF WATER OR SODA SOMETHING AND INSTEAD OF USING THE VIALS IT UM WELL IT TELLS YOU TO BUT A VIALS THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT IS UM IT DOESN'T TELL YOU AT ALL ANYTHING
IN IN THE SODA CAN
CAPACITY THE VOLUME BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALL THE WAY FILLED TO THE TOP
YEAH <BREATH>
MMM HMM WELL WELL WE HA WE HAD A BUNCH OF WATER TOO AND WE HAD THE THE <FP> I KEEP FORGETTING THE NAME NO THE UH GRADUATED CYLINDER YEAH <BREATH> GRADUATED CYLINDER AND UM IT WAS A P AND WE HAD TO FILL IT UP UH ABOUT TO A HUNDRED AND THEN UM WE HAD TO FILL IT UP TO A HUNDRED THEN WE
WELL WE HAD UM WHAT'S IT CALLED UM WE HAD ALL THESE SORTS OF UM <BREATH> WE HAVE THESE SORTS OF TOOLS THAT WE COULD USE UM ONE WAS CALLED A UM WHAT IS IT CALLED
MILLILITERS OR LET'S SEE
UM WE HAVE *BEEN* BEEN UH TALKING ABOUT THE VALUE THE VA- <BREATH> THE VALUE MMM HMM THE VOLUME IS WHEN UM SOMETHING IS FILLED UP ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP <BREATH> AND YESTERDAY WE WE F WE UM WE DID THE VOLUME OF A SODA CAN
DIDN'T TA WE DIDN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THAT BUT WE ONLY T
OH IS IT OH YEAH S
HUH SO WE UM <BREATH> WE WE UM <BREATH> WE FIRST GOT A BUNCH OF WATER THEN WE SUCKED IT UP FROM THE BIG CONTAINER THAT WE HAD THEN WE POU THEN WE POURED IT IN THEN THEN WE LEFT IT THERE THEN UM WE FILLED IT UP AGAIN AND THEN WE POURED IT IN AND WE KEPT DOING THAT UNTIL WE GOT OUR ANSWER
I THINK SO S
LET'S SEE
UM LET'S SEE
OH YEAH YEAH
MMM LET'S SEE
NO WE DIDN'T
NO BECAUSE UM YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WATER YOU PUT IN THERE
UM A HUNDRED
SO WHEN WE WERE DONE <BREATH> UM WE CHECKED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SODA CAN AND IT L AND AND WE CHECKED HOW MANY MILLIMETERS IT IT HOLDED AND IT HOLDED THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE
YEP
YEP
YEAH
LIKE
WE DON'T WE DIDN'T REALLY FIGURE IT BECAUSE UM SOME PEOPLE GOT LIKE LIKE UM THE SOME PEOPLE GOT BIGGER BIGGER WOOD CHIPS AND SOME PEOPLE GOT SMALLER WOOD CHIPS <BREATH> SO ONE OF THE TABLES GOT LIKE THEY GOT UM <FP> ABOUT FIFTEEN GRAMS OF THE WOOD CHIP
<BREATH> UM IT'S CALLED A BALANCE AND IT AND IT WEIGHS THINGS LIKE HOW MUCH IT W LIKE IT CAN WEIGHT ABOUT LET'S SEE IT CAN WEIGH LIKE LET'S SEE <BREATH> LIKE
<BREATH> HMM LET'S SEE
UM WE DID EM WITH CENTIMETERS WE DID EM <BREATH> UM HOW BIG OUR SE <FP> WE DID EM HOW WELL WH- WHAT PART OF OUR WELL WHAT PART OF OUR <BREATH> WHAT'S ONE PART OF WHAT'S ONE PART OF OUR BODY THAT'S ONE CENTIMETER
YEAH I WAS YEAH WE HAVE BEEN UM UM WHAT'S IT CALLED <FP> UM WEIGHING UM WE HAVE BEEN WEIGHING A WASHER A CHIP I THINK AND UH A WOOD A WOOD CHIP MMM HMM AND A YEAH PLAS YEAH YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
THE SAME YEAH EQUAL THAT'S MMM HMM
YEAH KINDA
YEAH
LET'S SEE
MMM HMM IT HAS TO BE ZERO YEAH
HMM MMM I DON'T REALLY KNOW IT'S YEAH A STANDARD
WE MEASURE OH I REMEMBER NOW WE MEASURED IT WITH UM WITH PAPER CLIPS <BREATH> SO SO WE COULD
UM IT WAS IMPORTANT ABOUT GRAMS IS THAT I'D SAY HMM
UM BECAUSE WE HAD UM WHAT'S IT CALLED A WHITE THING ON THE BACK ON THE BACK OVER THERE UM AND WE HAD TO MOVE IT AROUND SO THIS SO THE THE LITTLE THING HAS TO CO IT HAS TO BE BALANCED WITH THAT AND WE HAVE TO MOVE IT AROUND SO IT COULD BE BALANCED
OKAY
UM WE HAD TO WE W HAD TO WE HAD TO BALANCE THE MMM WE HAD TO BALANCE THE WASHER WITH A CHIP I THINK AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT THE WASHER WAS WAS UM WAS WAS UM WEIGHED MORE BECAUSE IT'S BECAUSE IT'S METAL
UM WE W HAVE BEEN MEASURING UM MEASURING BODY PARTS CLASSROOMS AND COMPUTERS
SIX GRAMS
YEAH UM OUR TABLE GROUPS GOT I TH YEAH TWELVE AND ANOTHER ONE GOT ONE AND ANOTHER ONE GOT <BREATH> I THINK IT WAS TEN AND ANOTHER ONE GOT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT WA TWO YEAH TWO
UM LIKE <BREATH> HMM LET'S SEE
OH A GRAM IS UM HEAVIER
YEAH WE DID IT WITH PAPER CLIPS I REMEMBER OKAY
UM WE HAD WE HAD TO MAKE SURE IT WAS BALANCED RIGHT SO WE PUT TWO CUPS IN THE SIDE WE SET IT UP AND THEN <BREATH> WE GOT TO BALANCE THINGS LIKE LIKE WOOD CHIPS CHIPPED AND WASHERS AND OTHER STUFF
OKAY
IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAU- BECAUSE IT COULD BECAUSE UM LET'S SEE SO IT COULD
LET'S SEE
UM <FP> PRETTY MUCH NO
SO WE COULD UM SO WE COULD S <FP> BUT OUR TEACHER TRICKED US BECAUSE SOME OF THE BECAUSE PART OF THE CLASS GOT SMALL ONES <BREATH> AND OTHERS GOT BIG ONES SO WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE'S WHICH ONE'S WORKED AND WE DECIDED THE BIG ONES WORKED BECAUSE IT HAD LESS <BREATH> UM ONE OF THE GROUPS HAD TWO I THINK TWO PAPER CLIPS BIG ONES
UM IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE <FP> LET'S SEE HMM
SO WHICH ONE'S
CENTIME <FP> GRAMS <BREATH> I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT GRAMS ARE <BREATH>
WHY DO WE DO IT WHY
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAD THE SAME KIND OF GRAMS
LET'S SEE
YEAH UM IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME KIND OF OBJECTS SAME SIZE
UM WE HAD TO USE ANOTHER OBJECT OBJECT AND WE USED UM GRAMS AND THERE WAS TWENTY GRAMS TEN GRAMS FIVE GRAMS AND ONE GRAM AND WE HAD TO FIRST MEASURE THE UM THE WASHERS YEAH THE WASHER AND IT WAS ABOUT
UM OH YEAH WHEN WE MEASURED THE WOOD CHIPS WITH UM GRAMS SOME PEOPLE GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS YEAH UM I
UM <FP> WE HAD TO CHECK IT AND CHECK IT AND CHECK IT AND CHECK IT AND FINALLY LIKE SO IF IT W SO WE HAD TO KEEP UM BALANCING AND BALANCING UNTIL IT WAS RIGHT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE GOT IT RI- WRONG <BREATH> AND SOME PEOPLE GOT IT RIGHT OR SOME PE- YEAH LIKE THAT UM THE UM THEY GOT THE THEY GOT THE BALANCE THEY GOT THE BALANCE LIKE BALANCED KIND OF BALANCED <BREATH> AND SOME PEOPLE GOT IT BALANCED RIGHT <BREATH> SO
AND WE DECIDED THAT THE SMALL ONES WAIT THERE'S A BIG OR SMALL WOULD WORK TO MEASURE RIGHT I THINK YEAH IT WAS BIG BECAUSE UM
OKAY SO
UM UM WE WE HAD TO SORT THEM IN THE CUP AND WE WE MEASURED ALL OF EM AND THEN WE HAD TO SORT THEM AND OUR TEACHER GAVE US UM THE GRAMS LIKE LIKE SQUARES THAT WERE GRAMS AND WE HAD TO MEASURE HOW MUCH GRAMS THEY WERE
YEAH
UM THE GRAMS TH THE GRAMS WORKED BETTER
YEAH HE IS
YEAH
UM IT WAS IT WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE SOME WERE BIG AND SOME WERE SMALL
UM <BREATH> IT'S IMPORTANT THAT GRAMS <FP> LET'S SEE LET'S SEE LET'S SEE
UH LET'S SEE
SO IT'S M THE SAME
UM A KILOGRAM
<FP> LET'S SEE
NO WE USED UM A POWDER I THINK
<BREATH> NO YEAH
THE YEAH YEAH
IT DOES BUT UM HMM
UM WATER BOTTLES UM WHAT ELSE WHAT ELSE LIKE
LET'S SEE
UM IT UM
YEP
OKAY ON THIS ONE
UM LET'S SEE
IT WEIGHS MORE
YEAH UM WELL WE KINDA DID THE SAME THING UM WE FIRST PUT ONE WATER BOTTLE ON ONE SIDE AND THEN THE OTHER AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT ONE SIDE WAS ON THE LOWER AND THE OTHER ONE WAS HIGHER AND THE ONE THAT WAS LOWER UM UH WEIGHED THE MOST
IT IT WAS KIND OF IT WAS UH IT'S THAT THING RIGHT THERE UH YEAH FULCRUM YEAH THE FULCRUM WE HAD TO YEAH WE HAD TO BALANCE IT WITH UM WE HAD TO BALANCE IT SO IT COULD BE EQUAL
OH YEAH MASS
UM WE HAD TO UM WE HAD TO BALANCE IT BECAUSE UM THERE WAS LIKE THIS LITTLE THING I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT <BREATH> UM UH WHAT IT CALLED
UM THAT IS UM A KILOGRAM ACTUALLY THAT IS ABOUT A HUNDRED GRAMS
UM IT'S SOMETHING THAT WEIGHS THAT WEIGHS LIKE
WE DID LOTS OF STUFF LIKE UH
YEAH
UM UM I WAS LIKE THE BIGGEST AND SOME PEOPLE GOT LIKE TWO WITH THE BIG ONES THEY WERE BIGGER
UM LET'S SEE
<BREATH> SO WE HAD A BALANCED SO WE HAD A BALANCE BALANCE AND UM AND UM AND UM W SO WE HAD T WE IT HAD TO LET'S SEE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM WE FIGURED OUT THAT WE NEEDED UM UM TEN BA- TEN SETS OF A HUNDRED TO MAKE A KILOGRAM BECAUSE A KILOGRAM IS A THOUSAND UM GRAMS
LIKE WEIGHS MORE THAN ONE THING OR LESS
WITH UM WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WITH UM UM
UM WELL WE WROTE IT DOWN ON A PIECE OF PAPER THEN WE PUT THAT MUCH THAT WELL WE HAD A HUNDRED GRAMS <BREATH> AND TO PE- WE HAD A HUNDRED GRAMS AND THEN WE HAD WELL WE DIDN'T QUITE GUESS BUT UM THERE WA THERE WAS A HUNDRED GRAMS IN THE IN ONE CUP AND IN THE OTHER WAS ANOTHER CUP OF POWDER AND WE HAD TO TAKE SOME OUT AND UNTIL IT WAS UNTIL IT WAS EQUAL
UM EQUAL UM THEY HAVE TO BE THE SAME SIZE
UM WATER BOTTLES <BREATH> MMM
WHOA OH YEAH
HUH LET'S SEE
IT WOULD BE IT WOULD JUST FALL DOWN YEAH
FIFTY S SIXTY A HU A HUNDRED
UM WE PUT EM WE PUT EM ON EACH CUP AND UH Y YEAH UM THAT ONE WAS HEAVIER AND ONE WAS LIGHTER
YEAH TO ONE GRAM AND UM
UM WE MEASURED TO S UM TO SEE HOW M HOW MUCH SOMETHING *WEIGHED* WEIGHT LIKE LIKE SOME THINGS *WEIGHED* W OH LIKE WE MEASURED UM WE MEASURED F UM WE MEASURED UM UM I THINK IT WAS UM UM PAPER CLIPS AND WE HAD TO AND WE HAD TO ME AND WE HAD TO EQUAL IT S AND AND WE HAD TO PUT EM AND WE HAD TO EQUAL UM SOME WERE BIGGER AND SOME WERE SMALLER
UM MY GROUP HAD UM IT WAS TWELVE I THINK YEAH TWELVE
I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER BUT IT WAS A STAN AND UM
A THOU GRAMS
LESS
UM <BREATH> YOU
UM BECAUSE UM IT'S IT'S IT'S STRAIGHT AND THE FULCRUM IS IS IN THE MIDDLE
YEAH UM IT WAS IT UM SOME PEOPLE ESTIMATED <BREATH> UM P LIKE OVER IT LIKE SOME PEOPLE GUESSED IT RIGHT AND SOME PEOPLE GUESSED IT OVER <BREATH> AND THEY AND THEY HAD TO PUT THAT MUCH IN AND THEY FIGURED OUT IT WAS MORE AND THEY HAD TO AND THEY HAD TO DO RIGHT ANSWER
BECAUSE IT WASN'T EQUAL
LET'S SEE HUH WE MEASURED UM I THINK WE MEASURED UM WE MEASURED OH WE COMPARED WE COMPARED THINGS TO EACH OTHER AND MEASURED THEM SO UM WE FIGURED OUT UM THAT SOME THINGS BECAUSE UM WE HAD LIKE UM WE HAD GRAMS AND THE GRA- MMM UM AND UM WE HAD LIKE F FIFTY NO SIXTY FIVE GRAMS AND SOME THINGS WEIGHED OVER A HUNDRED GRAMS SO UM UM WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT WITH UM WITH
WHOA
WE WORKED WITH CHIPS UM WE WORKED WITH WASHERS <BREATH> WE WORKED WITH UM <BREATH> MMM LOTS OF THINGS WITH WATER BOTTLES AND WE MEASURED HOW MUCH IT WEIGHED
UM THAT SOME THAT SOME WERE SMALLER AND SOME WERE BIGGER SO S SO SOME PEOPLE GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
UH NO BECAUSE YOU ARE TALLER THAN I AM
UM MEASURING AH I JUST FORGOT UH IT'S IMPORTANT TO UH WHAT WAS IT
UH I DON'T THINK SO
WE WERE WEIGH WELL WE HAD IN SCIENCE WE HAVE BEEN WEIGHING AND MEASURING
WELL WE WERE WELL WERE WERE ACTUALLY WEIGHING IT BECAUSE UM YOU WE WERE WEIGHING IT UM TO SEE HOW MUCH MILLILITERS IT HAD AND AND AND SINCE ALL OF THE COKE AND SINCE ALL OF THE COKE UM COKE UM WHAT'S IT CALLED COKE BOTTLES ARE THE SAME SIZE UM UH WE THOUGHT WE WE ALL THOUGHT THAT WE MIGHT GET THE SAME ANSWERS BUT SOME GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE UM BECAUSE SOME FILLED IT UP A LITTLE WAY TOO MUCH
BECAUSE IF YOU USE LIKE
NO
OH UH WITH CENTIMETERS AND INCHES NO BECAUSE CENTIMETERS ARE SMALLER THAN INCHES
UH WE DID BUT UM BUT UM IS BUT WHEN I POUR IT ALL THE WAY OUT WE HAVE TO SEE WE HAVE TO COUNT UM HOW MANY HOW MANY WATER IT HAD LEFT
UH YEAH UH YEAH
UM WE HAVE LIKE UH WE HAVE
SYRINGE
YEAH
UH WHAT IS IT AGAIN IT'S UM IT'S UH
OUR RESULTS WERE DIFFERENT UM SOME PEOPLE GOT THREE HUN SOME PEOPLE GOT A LITTLE A LITTLE WAY OVER UM LIKE SOME PEOPLE GOT ONE HUNDRED SOMETHING AT THE VERY VERY TOP SOME PEOPLE GOT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SOMETHING THIRTY FOUR I THINK AND
UM MEASURING HOW WE ARE HOW TALL WE ARE
YEAH
UM WE COULD GET BETTER RESULTS
SO THEY'RE ALL THE SAME
UH WE HAVE BEEN MEASURING WE'VE BEEN MEASURING LOTS OF THINGS WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT METERS UM METERS UH UH KILOMETER
AND WHAT ELSE
YEAH
YEAH UM THEY ARE LIKE
OH WHAT IS IT
UH I DON'T THINK TO BECAUSE A METER IS LONGER THAN YOUR HAND
UH-HUH YEAH HOW MUCH IT COULD HOLD
YEAH YEAH YEAH WELL SINCE ALL OF US KNEW HOW TO COUNT BY FIFTY UM WE EACH POURED IT IN AND THEN UM AND THEN WE COUNT IT UP UNTIL WE GOT OUR ANSWER
UM WHAT IS IT CALLED WHAT IS IT CALLED WHAT IT CALLED WHAT IS IT CALLED WHAT IS IT CALLED UH
UH BIGGER THAN CENTIMETERS MMM HMM MMM HMM
HOW MUCH IS A MILE HOW MUCH IS A MILE
UH DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOUR HAND'S SMALLER THAN A RULER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WELL YOU FIRST PULL THIS UP AND THE UNTIL IT GETS TO THE BOTTOM UNTIL IT GETS FILLED ALL THE WAY UP AND THEN YOU SEE AND THEN AT THE NUMBER DID YOU SEE HOW MUCH IT HOLDS AND THOSE ARE CALLED WHAT ARE THOSE CALLED WHAT ARE THOSE CALLED I THINK MILLILITERS
METERS
BECAUSE UM IF YOU LOOK IN INCHES OFF A RULER YOU WOULD GET BETTER RESULTS BECAUSE UM YOU CAUSE YOUR HAND COULD BE ABOUT SIX INCHES AND THE RULER'S ABOUT TWELVE IN TWELVE INCHES AND YOU CAN MEASURE BETTER
UM THEY COULD BE ANY SIZE AND THEY CAN BE AND IF YOU POUR THE SAME IT COULD BE FILLED UP IT COULD BE IT COULD BE FILLED FILLED UP
YES
THAT UM THAT THAT THEY W THAT WHEN YOU OPEN A SODA CAN IT'S NOT FILLED ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
UH THAT ONE UM BECAUSE IT'S WELL I DON'T THINK THAT ONE IS SUPPOSED TO MOVE WATER BECAUSE UM IT'S TALLER AND IT'S AND IT'S NOT AS WIDE
UM IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE SOMETHING THAT SUCKS UP WATER OR SOMETHING
UH WHAT WAS IT AGAIN WHAT WAS IT AGAIN WHAT WAS IT AGAIN
UM BECAUSE YOU COULD SEE HOW MANY BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE HOW MANY BECAUSE OF WHEN YOU PULLED IT PULLED IT ALL TO THE TOP IT WOULD TELL US A NUMBER AND THEN IT AND THEN IT WOULD
SYRINGES UM
YOUR HAND'S GOING TO BE BIGGER
YEAH
<BREATH> WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT MEASURING IS THAT UM
MY HANDS AND
AND WE WEIGHED UM HOW M AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH HOW MUCH UM MILLILI- MILLILITERS IT HAS
UH YEAH
I THINK THAT ONE HAS THE MOST YEAH
WELL WE USED IT SO IT COULD HELP US UM GET OUR ANSWERS RIGHT
BETTER RESULTS UM BECAUSE UH RULER GOT KIND OF THE RIGHT ANSWER BECAUSE UM WE WOULD USE CENTIMETERS AND OR INCHES AND UM
UH-HUH IT'S A LITER IS A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
YOU'RE GONNA GET BETTER RESULTS BECAUSE UM
UH WHAT IS IT WHAT WAS THE WORD YEAH
UH WE LEARNED THAT A MILE IS HOW MUCH UH HOW MUCH IS IT
I KNOW THERE'S A WORD BUT I FORGET UM
YEAH I WANNA VIDEOTAPE MY TONSILS AGAIN
YEAH UH-HUH
OH YEAH <LAUGH> <BREATH>
YEAH IT STARTED WITH THE SMALLEST AND IT WENT TO THE HIGHEST N MMM IT WORKED
MMM MMM YEAH
MILLIONS
<FP> AND MEASURE THE DOOR
THEN WE MEASURED THE ROOM AND WITH SOME MEDIUM SIZED PACE
I KNOW BUT THIS BUT BUT MY ARM SPAN WAS WAS WAS ACTUALLY LONGER THAN HOW TALL I WAS AND IT WAS MORE THAN A METER
WELL W ONE WAS ONE FIFTY NINE MINE WAS ONE SIXTY MY GROUP WAS AND UM ANOTHER ONE WAS ONE SIXTY FIVE ANOTHER ONE WAS WAS WAS ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND EN AND YET ANOTHER ONE WAS ONE EIGHTY THREE <LAUGH>
HE'S MEASURING HIS HEIGHT
A SH I WANNA LOOK AT THE GR- GROUP STRAWS UH GROUP STRAWS
YEAH BUT I WANNA GO TO MORE STUFF ON A S AND I WANT THE
I WANNA SEE THE OTHER METER STICK
HUNDRED
METER STICK METER STICK ONE AND METER STICK TWO WHAT'S I METER S STICK
I DON'T KNOW BUT I SE UH I FORGOT WHAT I WROTE ABOUT THAT
OH YEAH OH YEAH
OH I WANT TO DO THE MORE ADVANCED I WANNA DO THE MORE ADVANCED METER STICK <BREATH> I WANNA DO THE MORE ADVANCED METER STICK
UH OKAY YEAH AND IT I LIK- WE KNOW THERE'S HUNDRED THOUSANDTHS OF A ME
THAT THAT THE STRAWS ARE NOT GOOD
I WANNA LOOK AT MORE STUFF BUT
EH BECAUSE THIS ONE'S BUMPY YEAH BUT NOW I WANNA LOOK AT SOMETHING ELSE <BREATH> LIKE I WANNA SEE WITH NANOMETERS
THERE'S <FP> W IS THERE ANY KILOMETERS
YEAH
UH IT SHOWS YOU
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I CLICK ON SCALE <BREATH>
OH YEAH
MEASURE THE WALL OF YOUR FAMILY RO E
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I CLICK THERE
UM UM A THOUSAND CAN YOU GO TO MILLIMETER THERE CAN YOU CLICK ON AND THEN CLICK AGAIN NO NO I WANNA CLICK MILLIMETER CLICK MILLIMETER SEE LOOK W W THERE'S TEN IN ONE INCH
WHAT IS
I LEARNED THAT WE WERE SORT OF EVERYBODY'S JUST SORT OF IN BETWEEN ONE FIFTY AND TWO HUNDRED
I LI I L I LIKE LOOKING AT THE MILLIMETERS
THE WE DID THAT ONE I WANTED TO METER *CHALKBOARD* WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT ONE YET
PINKIE
UP TO A DOOR KNOB
AND
WHAT'S INVESTIGATION TWO
GREAT
OKAY NOT WHAT I I WANNA LOOK AT <FP> THE <BREATH> THE S METER STICK
YEAH
<LAUGH> NO
PACES IS WHAT WE DID <FP> METER TAPE IT MOVES
TEN AND THERE'S TEN DECIMETERS AND ONE
MAYBE I WOULD USE MILLIMETERS TO BE
IN ONE METER
VIDEOTAPING MY TONSILS <LAUGH> TONSILS <LAUGH>
THREE THREE AND A HALF FOUR MMM HMM YES FOUR METERS
YEAH <LAUGH>
NO ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED WE MEASURED FROM OUR ROOM ALL THE WAY TO THE OFFICE
LIKE LIKE FURNITURE
I ACTUALLY LIVE IN LOUISVILLE
MMM YEAH I FOUND OUT THAT I WAS WELL I MADE THAT MY ARM SPAN WAS WAS WAS MORE THAN HOW TALL I AM
WE DON'T KNOW WE ALL MEASURED WITH THE SAME MEDIUM SIZED PACE
UH IT'S THREE METERS LONG BUT ACTUALLY I <FP>
NO
MMM TEN CENTIM- WHAT'S METER METER <FP> N AWW NO
UM WE MEASURED EACH OTHER WITH METERS AND ST S
ONE OKAY SO WHAT ELSE IS IS THERE
NO <FP> BUT WE HAD A PIECE OF PAPER WHICH WAS A MEDIUM <BREATH> SIZED PACE
YEAH I KNOW
MMM MEASURING LONG DISTANCES LIKE THE SCHOOL TO THE HOUSE
UM WHEN W YOU'RE MOVING TO A NEW HOUSE ALTHOUGH I'VE NEVER DONE THAT
MMM NOT NOT NOT USUALLY SOME OF EM
WHAT
NO I WANNA LOOK AT THE
WHAT IS
SORTA LIKE MATH AND UM
WELL NO IT DOESN'T SAY IT <LAUGH> SAY ROBBIE THE ROBOT <BREATH> KIND OF YEAH EXCEPT IT WASN'T COLOR
NO NO WE DIDN'T DO THAT WE A WE A ALL OF OUR STRAWS ARE THE SAME SIZE
YEAH BUT THE SMALL BUT THE OTHERS WANTED TO GO BACK UP TO S ONE THEN BUT THE GROUP STRAWS THEY GO KEEPS CH- <FP> AND WHERE IT SAYS GROUP STRAWS THE THE GROUP A STRAWS WERE A LOT LONGER THAN GROUP B
TEN
ONE CENTIMETER I ALWAYS GET MIXED UP
KILOMETERS
UM I'M NOT S QUITE SURE <LAUGH>
THEY'RE LIT TOO
I THINK THERE'S UM IT'S ABOUT UM LIGHT BULBS AND BATTERIES <BREATH>
THEY'RE LESS LIGHT
IN CLASS WE HAVE A PAPER THAT HAS THESE SYMBOLS AND IT THE WRONG DISC <LAUGH>
YEAH
-EAH
YES
THANKS <LAUGH>
UM I GUESS <LAUGH>
UM THE WIRES HAVE TO BE IN AND THE PLATE THE RED PLATES HAVE TO BE THERE FOR THE LIGHT TO TOUCH
BECAUSE WITH TWO BATTERIES THERE WAS MORE POWER
YEAH
UM WE JUST HAD THESE LITTLE SLOTS THAT ARE LIKE LOOPS AND ONCE WE PUT EM IN AND UM THERE'S A PLATE THAT GOES WITH THE LIGHT SO THEN IT HAS TO TOUCH THE BOTTOM SLIDE THING
THE CIRCLES WITH IN CURSIVE E IN IT ARE LIGHT THE LIGHTS AND THE LINES ARE SOLID ARE THE WIRE AND THE LONGER LINE AND THE SHORTER ONE IS THE BATTERY
YES
WE HAVE A LIGHT AND WIRES AND WE PUT THE BATTERY IN THIS SLOT AND THEN HOOK THE WIRES TO IT AND THEN HOOK THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT TOO
THEY HELP HOLD IT BECAUSE OR ELSE YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE LIGHT WHILE YOU PUT THE WIRES ON
THE LIGHTS S SCREW INTO THE LITTLE A LITTLE HOLE SO THEN IT TOUCHES THE BOTTOM THE BLACK PART TOUCHES THE BOTTOM SO WHEN THE WIRES ARE UM IN IT THE THE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE BOTTOM AND UP
THE F IT THE ENERGY FLOWS THE OTHER WAY
THE ELECTRICITY GOES FROM THE NEGATIVE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THEN COMES DOWN INTO THE OTHER ONE AND COMES BACK TO THE BATTERY
UM I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT I THINK IT'S BATTERIES AND TWO MOTORS
YEAH
THE WIRES HAVE TO BE IN SO THEN THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW IN THE LIGHT
I NOTICED THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED AND TOUCHING
ONE HAS TO BE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE OTHER HAS TO BE ON THE POSITIVE <BREATH> AND THEN THE OTHER ENDS OF THE WIRES HAVE TO BE IN THE LITTLE LOOPS SO IT CONNECTS TO THE LIGHT
THEY ARE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY
IF THEY'RE NOT AT LEAST TOUCHING THE BOTTOM PART THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T GET TO THE LIGHT BULB
YEAH <LAUGH>
THE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE AT LEAST HOOKED UP TO THE LITTLE PLATE
IF THEY'RE NOT HOOKED UP THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T GO FROM THE FROM THE BATTERY AND IT CAN'T GET TO THE LIGHT
THE ENERGY SWITCHED BECAUSE THE NEGATIVE IS NOW ON THE LEFT SIDE
YEAH <BREATH>
THE OTHER DIRECTION LIKE THE ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE RIGHT AND TO THE OTHER SIDE
UM WELL THE NA THE ELECTRICITY ALWAYS COMES OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE AND THEN COMES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
THE BULBS ARE LIT AND THE BOTTOM IS TOUCHING THE METAL ONTO THE PLATE
THEY'RE *NOT* THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT AS THE OTHER ONES
I HAVE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH ELECTRICITY AND A BATTERY
UM WELL AND SINCE THERE'S TWO BATTERIES THE LIGHT IS MUCH BRIGHTER
YEAH LIKE THAT <LAUGH>
UM I'M NOT QUITE SURE CAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO THAT
THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO IT SO THEN I THINK THE METAL UM HA PUTS PRESSURE ON IT SO I THINK UM IT STOPS
NO
UH WE HAD THESE LITTLE SYMBOLS AND WE SAW UM IN A KEY AND JUST UM SAW WHERE THE THINGS WERE
UH WE ALSO UM MADE A LIGHT BULB WORK
WELL IN MY OPINION I WER- I I DON'T THINK SO
UH WHAT
WELL THE ENERGY FROM THE NEGATIVE COMES UM IT F GOES UM OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE AND THEN IT WILL LIKE COME BACK F INTO THE POSITIVE SO THEN THE ENERGY GOES ALL UM LIKE UM IN A CIRCLE
THERE'S THESE TWO LITTLE SLOTS AND YOU PUT THE WIRE ON IT AND THE RED WIRE AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS METAL UM TURNY THINGIE THAT YOU PUT UNDER
UM I'M NOT EXACTLY QUITE SURE
GOOD
ON THE BATTERY IT HAS TO BE ON THE SIDES UM FOR THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE HAS TO UM CONNECT TO SOMEWHERE ON THE LIGHT BULB
YES WE DID
IT'S LIKE THE FIRST THING BUT WE HAD THIS UM PLAY AND A SMALL LIGHT BULB INSTEAD OF A A MOTOR
I THINK IT IS LIKE THE MOTOR AND THEN THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERY
I SEE THE LIGHT BULB THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY
UM IT ALWAYS COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
WILL START
E UM THE DRAWINGS RELATE BECAUSE UM EVERYTHING COMES BACK TO WHERE IT STARTED BUT IT GOES AWAY FOR LIKE A SQUARE AND IT COMES BACK
BECAUSE THE UM IT HAS TO GO THROUGH LIKE UM THIS LITTLE THING INSIDE OF IT
UH <LAUGH> UM WHAT <LAUGH>
THE SWITCH IS UM SO IT UM TURNS ON AND TURNS OFFTTU
UH WHAT THE BATTERY WAS AND THE LIGHT BULB AND ALL AND LIKE THE WIRE THINGS
THE ENERGY F UM WENT THE OTHER WAY
WE UM SO WE HAD A SWITCH WITH IT TOO SO WE HAD ANOTHER WIRE AND PUT UM ANOTHER ON SO THEN EH IF WE PUT THIS A METAL THING UNDER IT IT WILL STOP AND YEAH
WHAT <LAUGH>
UH THE ENERGY FROM THE UM THE D CELL BATTERY IT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRE
IT'S IT STOPS THE MOTOR AND THE UM CONNECTION
UM I DON'T THINK I SAW IT BU-
WE HAVE LIKE A MOTOR AND UM THAT IT CONNECTS TO WIRES SO WE PUT IT ON A BATTERY AND UM PUT THE WI- UM THE WIRES ONTO THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SO THAT IT WILL START SPINNING
A CIRCUIT IS LIKE UM WHEN ENERGY GOES AROUND AND COMES BACK
UH WE PUT IT UNDER
WELL IT KIND OF LOOKED LIKE IT STUCK UP AND IT FOLLOWED THE MAGNET WHEREVER IT WAS
AND WE PUT MAGNETS IN A BOX AND TAPE IT THEN USE DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS TO FIND IT
THERE'S METAL OR A MAGNET INSIDE THE COMPASS SO THEN IF THE ME A METAL OR UM LIKE A S ROCK SOMEWHERE UM IT POINTS IT OUT
IRON YEAH
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT KIND OF MAGNETS AND UM SOME ARE S I'M NOT SURE BUT I THINK SOME ARE STRONGER THAN THE OTHER
OKAY
WELL WHEN WE USED IT THE COMPASS KIND OF POINTED OUT WHERE IT WAS IN THE BOX SO THEN WE SEARCHED THAT AREA
TEELE
NAIL
GOOD
WHEN IT THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S NORTH SOUTH WEST AND EAST AND THEN THERE'S UM A LITTLE POINTER SO THAT YOU PUT IT IN THE DIRECTION AND THEN IT WILL S SPIN AROUND AND POINT OUT THE AREA
THE POWER WITH TWO MAGNETS GOING TOGETHER MA UM RELEASES MORE POWER SO THEN <BREATH> WHEN ANOTHER MAGNET COMES IT F IT SITS ON TOP OF IT
IRON AND NOT STEEL AND UM I'M NOT AND LIKE UM LIKE STUFF
YES WE DID
UM WELL IT FINDS THE UM IT TECHNICALLY FINDS UM METAL
THE MAGNET IS UM STICKING INTO THE UH IS UM LIKE STICKING TO THE PENCIL BUT IT'S UM BECAUSE THERE'S LEAD INSIDE THE PENCIL THAT'S WHAT WE USED TO WRITE AND THE MAGNET UM ATTRACTS TO THE <FP> UM LEAD
I THINK THE MAGNET WILL PICK UP THE ROCK THE PAPER CLIP UM THE NAILS AND I THINK IT'S LIKE A WASHER BUT I'M NOT SURE
NO IT DID NOT IT JUST UM KIND OF MOVED AROUND WHEREVER THE MAGNET WAS UNDER THE PLATE
THE DIFFERENCE IS UM THEY'RE NOT AS HEAVY AND THEY'RE NOT AS STRONG
UM I S UM MA MAGNETS ARE IMPORTANT FOR LIKE UM UM FOR LIKE THINGS THAT USE ELECTRICITY I THINK
YES
BECAUSE THE OTHERS ARE NOT MADE OF METAL AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE KIND OF METAL WOULD STICK TO MA A MAGNET
WE'VE BEEN DOING THINGS WITH MAGNETS
AND UM SOME I FOR
<FP> I'M NOT QUITE SURE <LAUGH>
WE WERE TRYING TO FIND THEM CAUSE OTHER GROUPS HID EM SOMEWHERE IN THE CARDBOARD BOX AND WE TRIED TO FIND IT
THE TWO WHAT WEREN'T TOGETHER
YEAH WITH MY OTHER UM PEOPLE IN MY GROUP
THERE IS COPPER
YEAH SO WHAT'S THE QUESTION <LAUGH>
I SEE THE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS OR MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER CAUSE ONE IS WEAK AND THE OTHER ISN'T
WELL WE HAD A PAPER UM PLATE AND THEN OUR TEACHER PUT SOME OF IT ON AND WE HAD A MAGNET AND PUT IT UNDER AND SEE H UM SAW HOW IT MOVED AROUND AND REACTED
TO F E SO THEN IT CAN FIND THE OTHER UM MAGNET
I THINK THAT THEY LOOK LIKE THE SAME KIND BUT THE POWER'S REALLY UM WEAK SO THEN IT WON'T LIKE AND THE OTHER ISN'T SO THEN UM IT THE FORCE DOESN'T WORK
BY USING LIKE A NAIL OR ANOTHER MAGNET AND THEN LIKE PUT IT ON THE BOX AND FIND IT TIL IT S FEELS
WHICH BAR
MMM WELL IT ONLY STICKS ONTO LIKE A SPECIAL KIND OF METAL AND UM YEAH
UM I'M NOT REALLY SURE
THE POINTING TELLS WHERE THE METAL IS AND LIKE YEAH
YEAH
THE ROCK I THINK AND THE
YES
THE IRON STUCK TO THE MAGNET CAUSE UM THE MAGNET HAS THIS THING IN IT THAT UM LIKE MAKES IT GO UP IT SO IT FOLLOWS IT BUT IT CAN'T EXACTLY STICK TO IT CAUSE THERE'S A PLATE
WE UM LIKE W WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THEY WERE SO WE USED UM MAGNETS LIKE I MEAN METAL AND A COMPASS TO FIND IT CAUSE THEY HID IT SOMEWHERE IN THE BOX
THE ME THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET WITH THE LEAD INSIDE THE PENCIL
THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF METALS AND THEY ONLY UM STICK TO CERTAIN KINDS
WELL IT DOESN'T EXACTLY FIND METAL IT JUST POINTS OUT WHERE IT IS
THE MAGNET IS STRONG ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER SO IT'S LIKE <FP> THE MAGNET POWER'S MAKING IT FLOW ON TOP OF THE OTHER MAGNETS
YES
UM THE OTHERS ARE THE SAME KIND SO THEY COULD BUT I'M NOT THE POWER'S I THINK DIFFERENT SO THEN THEY WON'T COME TOGETHER CAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME MATERIAL
I THINK <LAUGH>
THE WASHERS GOT UM THEY STUCK TO THE RIVET
I DON'T THINK SO BUT I'M NOT SURE IF I'M CORRECT IT'S JUST IN MY OPINION <LAUGH>
UM WE ALSO JUST WAIT I FORGET IT
WELL IF ER THE CIRCLE DOESN'T ALL CONNECT IT WON'T FLOW AND IF THE SWITCH ISN'T CONNECTING IT WON'T FLOW
NOTHING'S HAPPENING
WE WE JUST TRIED UM THE WIRE TOUCHING INSTEAD OF WRAPPING IT AROUND AND NOTHING HAPPENED
WE TRIED THAT AND NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE'S NO POWER GOING INTO IT
THE ELECTRICITY
WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MAG THE LITTLE RIVET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
WELL THE BATTERY GAVE THE POW UM UM LET THE POWER GO TO THE THE RIVET
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE RIVETS SO THEN IT CAN'T <BREATH> PICK UP THE WASHERS
I THINK THAT WHEN THE POWER GOES INTO THE METAL IT IT JUST DOES SOMETHING TO GET THE WASHERS TO GO UP
WE USE JUST NORMAL MAGNETS
GOOD
THE RIVET IS UM A MAGNET KIND OF SO THEN IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS
WE ASKED FOR HELP <LAUGH> FROM MR. MARCINI AND HE TOLD US TRY WRAPPING IT AROUND <BREATH> THE RIVET
WE MADE A MAGNET THAT CAN S TURN OFF AND ON
WE ALSO HAD TO CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE SWITCH THAT'S HOW IT CAN TURN OFF AND ON SO THEN IT DOESN'T FLOW BACK TO THE BATTERY
WELL FIRST WE HAD A RIVET AND A SHORT WIRE AND A LONG WIRE WE ALSO HAD A BATTERY AND WE FIRST CON TRIED TO CONNECT ALL OF THEM TOGETHER AND WE HAD TO WRAP AROUND THE WIRE LIKE FORTY OR THIRTY TIMES TO THE RIVET
WELL I'M NOT SO QUITE SURE BUT I THINK IT'S A SPECIAL METAL BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE <LAUGH>
THE RIVET IS PICKING UP THE LITTLE WASHERS
UM WHAT DID YOU SAY <LAUGH>
ER WAIT WHAT <LAUGH>
NO THEY WON'T
THEY PICKED UP THE LITTLE WASHERS FROM THE LITTLE RIVET AND WE HAD TO HAVE A LOT OF POWER SO WE WRAPPED IT A LOT
WE UM HAD A SWITCH AND LITTLE WASHERS TOO AND WE JUST PUT THEM IN SPECIAL PLACES AND WRAPPED IT AROUND AND CONNECTED ALL OF THEM TOGETHER TO TRY TO MAKE IT WORK AND PICK UP THE WASHERS
YES
THE WIRE
YES
THE ELECTRICITY ALWAYS COMES OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND COMES BACK IN THE UM POSITIVE SIDE SO IT GOES LIKE IN A CIRCLE BACK TO WHERE IT STARTED
(())
YOU ONLY EAT PLANTS AND HERB
AN OMNIVORE
IT MAKES IT SO IT THE PLANTS GET THEIR NUTRIENTS AND THEN THE HERBIVORES CAN EAT THE PLANTS AND THE FOOD (())
HERBIVORE
A PRIMARY (())
(())
HERBIVORES ONLY EAT PLANT
THEY CAN (()) THE ENERGY TO GET IT
THEY ARE DEER MOOSE AND BUNNIES WHICH EAT PLANTS LIONS AND POLAR BEARS WHICH EAT ONLY MEAT OMNIVORES HUMANS AND BEARS WHICH EAT MEAT AND LIKE FRUIT AND EARTH WORMS AND FUNGI WHICH ARE DETRIVORES THAT EAT DECAYING (())
(())
A SECONDARY CONSUMER
ANIMALS EAT OTHER ANIMALS AND PLANTS TO GET THEIR ENERGY
THEY ARE DECOMPOSERS
IT IS THE BIOSPHERE
A PLANT MAKES IT'S OWN ENERGY WITH SUNLIGHT AND UM DIRT
PLANTS
(())
IT GETS THE ENERGY FROM WELL THE DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS AND THEY DECOMPOSE
THE ENVIRONMENT
THEY GET RID OF THE UM DEAD STUFF AND TURN IT INTO SOIL NUTRIENTS FOR THE PLANTS TO GROW AND THE CYCLE STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN
ANIMALS BEARS LIONS POLAR BEARS BUNNIES YEAH ALL ANIMALS
IT MEANS THAT YOU EAT OTHERS THINGS TO GET
EACH ANIMAL HAS A PLACE IN THE ECOSYSTEM AND UM THEY ARE (())
THEY'RE DECAY NO NOT THEY'RE DECOMPOSERS
GOOD
AN OMNIVORE
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
THEY UM TURN THE LEAVES AND STUFF
THIS IS THE BIOSPHERE IT IS
THEY EAT BOTH PLANTS AND MEATS SO ALL OF THE FOODS (())
THEY DECOMPOSES STUFF (())
THEY TURNS INTO DIRT
UM PLANTS AND MEAT AND AND (())
<NO_SIGNAL>
THEY ARE PART OF FOUR (()) OF THE EARTH THEY ARE BIOSPHERE THE BIOSPHERE
A DECOMPOSER UM WELL DECOMPOSES LIKE DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS AND TURNS THEM INTO SOIL LIKE SOME DECOMPOSERS ARE BACTERIA BACTERIA FUNGI OR
BEING A PRODUCER MEANS UM YOU PRODUCE THE ENERGY YOURSELF
THEY PRODUCE THE ENERGY SO THEY ARE (())
PLANTS UM (())
THE PRODUCERS PRODUCE THE FOOD FOR UM FOR THE (())
A (())
THE THEY ARE THE BEETLE THE SPARROW BUNNY SALAMANDER
THE (()) THE GRASS
<DISCARD>
IT CREATES ALL THE (()) THAT HAS (()) THINGS IN THE WORLD
SHUT UP
AN OMNIVORE
GETTING ALL THE FOOD FROM THE THING THAT EATS THE PLANT TO GET THE SUNS ENERGY AND WHATNOT
(()) WE HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING THIS
(()) I ALREADY TOLD YOU MEAT
I DON'T KNOW
(())
(()) IS ALL ABOUT THINGS THAT GROW ON THE GROUND AND BACTERIA YOU GET IT
SHUT UP
DECOMPOSER EATS ALL THE STUFF AROUND IT
A CARNIVORE EATS MEAT
DEER EATS THE RABBIT AND THE RABBIT EATS THE GRASS
TO EAT (())
A MOSQUITO
I DON'T KNOW
DECOMPOSERS EAT RAW THINGS ON LAND
<DISCARD>
(())
IT GETS ITS ENERGY FROM THE SUN
BECAUSE OF THE THE CARBON DIOXIDE THAT GOES INTO THEM AND THE SUN DUH
A CARNIVORE
CAUSE CAUSE IT GETS THE ENERGY FROM THE SUN
(()) ANIMALS CONSUMER OKAY
NO WE HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING THIS
THEY ARE IMPORTANT IN A FOOD WEB BECAUSE THEY ALL EAT EACH OTHER LIKE THE SHARK EATS THE BIRD OR THE BEAR EATS THE BIRD OR THE BEAR EATS THE MONKEY THE THE (()) OR WHATEVER IT IS EATS THE FISH AND THE HAWK EATS THE (()) BUNNY
EARTH WORMS ARE (()) YOU IDIOT
GOOD
THE BACTERIA
I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
WE HAVE NOT BEEN DOING THIS
(()) THAT CREATES (())
(()) AND BERRIES
(()) THE CONSUMERS EAT I DON'T KNOW
EATING THE FOOD BUT THE ENERGY COMES CONSERVES TO THEM FROM ON LAND LIKE IF A CRABBY NO NOT A CRAB AN ANT ANTEATER EATS A PLANT THEN AN ANT EATS A PLANT AND AN ANTEATER EATS A PLANT EATS THAT ANT AND IT GETS ALL ITS ENERGY FROM THE PLANT
THEY EAT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD EVEN CAR
BY SETTING OFF THE COMPUTER
YES
THAT THEY LIKE THAT ENVIRONMENT
THE SUNS ENERGY
(())
THE SNAKE
CAUSE CARNIVORES ONLY EAT MEAT OKAY
OMNIVORES ONLY EAT BERRIES AND AND MEAT
CLEANING OFF THINGS THAT COME FROM THE SUN ON AN ANIMAL AND THE MUSHROOMS GET THE (()) FROM THE SUNS ENERGY GOES TO THE MUSHROOMS WEE
THEY WILL DIG HOLES IN IT AND EAT THE FOOD INSIDE THE DIRT
A HAWK
CARNIVORE
GOOD
SHUT UP
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY AND ALL THE LIVING CELLS INSIDE OF IT
THESE ARE ALL THE YEAST CELL
OF THE HUMAN BODY CELLS AND THE ANIMAL CELLS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT
ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY AND ALL OF IT THE PARTS OF IT
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
ALL THE LIVING CELLS AND OTHER PLANTS
I SEE SOME SORT OF DESIGN BUT I CAN TELL WHAT IT IS
IMPORTANT TO THESE IS A KIND OF SKIN CELLS IS HOW WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HEALTHY HEARTS
WHAT'S UP WITH THE TWO TYPES OF CELLS IS THEY EACH HAVE DIFFERENT PATTERNS THE YEAST CELLS ALL CONNECT IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN THE HUMAN CELLS
WHEN I CLICK ON THE LEG I NOTICED A WHOLE BUNCH OF LITTLE BUGS INSIDE OF
THAT THERE'S A BLANK SCREEN IN FRONT OF ME
THAT THEY HAVE LITTLE TINY STRINGS COMING OUT OF THEM CALLED NEUMRONS AND EVERY TIME YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW A NEW NEUMRON COMES OUT
THEY BOTH HAVE CELLS
THE BRAIN CELLS WITH THE NEURONS COMING OUT OF HIM
I SEE THE BRAINS NEURONS CONNECTING TO EACH OTHER TO MAKE THE PERSON SMARTER
(())
THE MOUTH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SO CAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A MOUTH HOW WOULD YOU CHEW YOUR FOOD AND GO DOWN THE ESOPHAGUS TO LIKE SO IT WOULDN'T HURT YOUR THROAT
I THINK THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM'S ALL ABOUT WHERE EVERYTHING LIKE THE FOOD GOES TO DIGEST IT GOES INTO THE MOUTH DOWN THE ESOPHAGUS AND INTO THE STOMACH THEN IT GOES INTO THE SMALL INTESTINES WHICH THEN GOES INTO THE LARGE INTESTINES THE SMALL INTESTINES JUST MAKES IT SMALLER BUT THE FOOD THAT YOUR BODY DOESN'T LIKE IT GOES OUT THE BIG INTESTINES FOR WASTE REMOVAL OUT THE ANUS
WE LEARNED THAT THE MOUTH BREAKS DOWN THE FOOD WITH THIS WATER LIQUID CALLED SALIVA SO THAT IT WOULD HELP THE FOOD BREAK DOWN AS YOU'RE CHEWING IT
THE LARGE INTESTINES IS FOR THE WASTE REMOVAL AND THE SMALL INTESTINES IS FOR THE FOOD TO GO DOWN
I NOTICE HUMAN BODY WITH THE WRIST HIGHLIGHTED THE HEAD THE BRAIN HIGHLIGHTED AND THE THIGH HIGHLIGHTED
THE HUMAN'S DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IS BIGGER THAN THE BUTTERFLY'S DIGESTIVE SYSTEM CAUSE BUTTERFLIES ARE SMALLER THAN OTHER MAMMALS LIKE THE HUMAN FOR EXAMPLE HAS A BIGGER DIGESTIVE SYSTEM FROM ALL OF THE THE STOMACH THE AND THE ALL THE
THAT THEY HOLD THE SKIN TOGETHER WITH THE FLESH
BRAIN CELLS ON THE ANIMALS MAKE THEM SMARTER THE SKIN CELLS ARE ALL OVER THE ANIMAL'S BODY LIKE OURS AND WITH THE BRAIN CELLS LIKE OURS AND THE LEG THEY HAVE THE SAME CELLS AS THE MUSCLE CELLS US TO KEEP US STANDING UP
ALL OF THE PLANTS IN THE GROUND LIKE THE ROOTS
THE HUMAN DIGESTIVE SYSTEM GOES WITH FOOD BECAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A DIGESTIVE SYSTEM YOUR FOOD WOULDN'T BE BREAKING DOWN THAT GOOD AND GOING INTO YOUR BLOOD STREAM
ALL OF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM ON A HUMAN
ESOPHAGUS LEADS THE FOODS INTO THE STOMACH
THEY ARE THE BIGGEST PART OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
BYE
DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS HELP YOUR FOOD BREAK DOWN AND GO INTO YOUR BLOOD
DOING WELL HOW HOW ARE YOU
THE STOMACH HAS THIS LIQUID ACID THAT WILL RISE UP AND THE FOOD COMES DOWN AND IT WILL MELT THE FOOD DOWN
THIS COULD BE TRYING TO SHOW ME THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CELLS EACH ANIMAL HAD
A LIVING CELL WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING IS
I DON'T KNOW
THE ESOPHAGUS OR THE ESOPHAGUS SLIDES DOWN TO YOUR YOUR FOOD SO AND STARTS BREAKING IT DOWN A LOT MORE AND THEN GOES TO YOUR STOMACH
I NOTICED A BUNCH OF LITTLE CELLS IN THE YEAST AND IN THE SKIN CELLS
THE MOUTH CHEWS DOWN ALL OF YOUR FOOD ALL OF YOUR FOOD SO YOU YOU WILL IT WILL BREAK DOWN IN SALIVA WHICH IS A WATER LIQUID WILL HELP IT BREAK
THEY DIGEST FOOD TO GO INTO YOUR BLOOD STREAM
THE LIQUID ACID
WHAT MAIN POINTS
MUSCLE CELLS ARE THE MOST PART OF THE BODY SO THAT YOU COULD RUN OR WALK OR EVEN STAND UP
YES BECAUSE OF THE ANIMALS THE MAMMOTH MAMMALS ALL HAVE THE SAME SKIN CELLS
IT LOOKS LIKE WHOLE BUNCH OF WORMS CONNECTING TOGETHER
I SEE SOME SORT OF WEIRD LITTLE CELL AND IN THE PLANT CELL THAT'S MORE DIFFERENT THAN THE HUMAN CELLS
IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE A BUTTERFLY HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CELLS LIKE HUMANS YEAST PLANTS AND OTHER LIVING ORGANISMS ORGANISMS I MEAN
I THINK THIS CAN BE TRYING TO SHOW ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PART OF CELLS THAT ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS HAVE
THEY ARE MADE OF FLESH AND THAT THE SKIN CELLS CONNECT TO
HOW IT COMPARES TO THE HUMAN CELLS IS THE HUMAN CELLS HAVE MORE THAN THE LEAVES AND ONE LEAF CAUSE THE HUMAN IS JUST ONE BIG PART OF EVERYTHING
THEY EACH HAVE DIFFERENT PATTERNS ON THEM
WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING THE HOW WHEAT IF IT CAN GROW IN THE DARK OR IT CAN BETTER IN THE DARK OR GROW BETTER IN THE LIGHT AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT BUTTERFLIES
WHAT IT TELLS ME ABOUT HUMANS AND CELLS IS ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY DO
IT SHOWS US THE DIFFERENT PARTS ON THE BUTTERFLY AND THE HUMAN LIKE THERE'S LIKE A LITTLE GREEN THINGS LITTLE GREEN LINES COMING OUT WHERE THE IT SHOWS US AND THE HUMAN HAS A LITTLE DOTTED LINE TO WHERE ONE LITTLE THING IS ALL THE OTHER LITTLE CELLS INSIDE IT
I THINK THE HUMAN HAS THE MOST CELLS CAUSE IT'S LIKE A BIG PART OF A BODY INSTEAD OF LIKE ONE LITTLE THING LIKE THE YEAST ONLY HAS ONE CELL BUT THE LEAF HAS A LOT OF CELLS BUT NOT MORE THAN THE HUMAN
IT BREAKS DOWN FOOD
A SEE UM THE AXLES AND THE WHEELS WHICH HELP THE CAR MOVE
I THINK THAT THEY UM HAVE UM THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED LIKE A SPARROW IT'S A SECONDARY CONSUMER AND THERE'S ALSO ONLY CONSUMERS
NO
THE DIFFERENT COLORS ON THE MAP REPRESENT A WHOLE KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS
MOST OF THE BIOSPHERE IS MADE UP OF SAND AND LIVING CREATURES
THE FLOW OF ENERGY COMES FROM THE SUN WHICH IF THE ANIMAL EATS A PLANT WHICH GOES TO THE SUN IT WILL GO TO THEM AND IF THEY GET EATEN THE ENERGY WILL GO STRAIGHT TO THE ANIMAL THAT EATS THE OTHER ONE
UM IT HAS THE EARTH IT HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF SYSTEMS LITTLE SUBSYSTEMS
I THINK A FOOD WEB SHOWS THE WAIT WHAT OH YEAH I THINK A FOOD WEB THING IS A A THINGY
REPEAT
<SILENCE>
THAT IT HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF SUBSYSTEMS
EARTH IS A SYSTEM BECAUSE UM IT ALL THE LITTLE SUBSYSTEMS THAT HELP THE CARS TRAINS AND OTHER THINGS RUN AND MOVE
BECAUSE IT HAS A LITTLE A WHOLE BUNCH OF LITTLE SUBSYSTEMS IN IT TO HELP THE EARTH WORK
<SILENCE>
THE FOOD WEB'S UM THEY EACH HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FOOD WHICH THEY EAT HUNT KILL OR TAKE THE TAKE THEM TO THEIR BABIES SO THAT THEY CAN GROW
THEY ALL LIVE ON THE EARTH UH UH
UH WE'VE BEEN UM
THE FOOD WEB MEANS TO ME A BUNCH OF ECOSYSTEMS THAT WILL EAT EACH OTHER OR THEY WILL EAT THEM
IT SHOWS ALL THE PARTS TO
THAT THERE'S A SNOW HAIR THAT WILL LIKE EAT LIKE PLANTS UM THE PLANTS MIGHT MEET THE ANIMAL LIKE THE PURPLE AND THE GRASS MUD WITH AND THE SNOW HAIR WILL EAT THE RAT WITH THE OWLS THE RAT CAN ALSO EAT THE OWL NO WAIT THE OWL CAN EAT THE SNOW HAIR
UH ALL THE PARTS OF THE EARTH ON A CAR
I THINK THE BIOSPHERE'S MADE UP OF ALL THE LAND THE WATER AND TREES AND NO HOUSES AROUND
THEY WORK UM BY THE HEART IT HELPS YOU BREATHE AND IN THE VEINS THEY HELP YOU LIKE MEMORIZE AND THE LUNGS AND THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM HELP YOU NOT TOO LIKE GET TO FULL OR SOMETHING
I SEE A MOUNTAIN TREES HOUSES AND AN OCEAN
THEY'RE PART OF UH NATURE AND HUMANS
I SEE UH ALL THE ECOSYSTEMS IN THE EARTH WHERE OTHER ANIMALS LIVE LIKE THE BURROW FOREST THE WETLANDS AND THE DESERT
SYSTEMS HAVE UM IN COMMON WITH THE BIOSPHERE IS WHERE THE ANIMALS AND THE PEOPLE LIVE AND WHERE CERTAIN THINGS LIVE LIKE THE SPIDER IT CAN SOMETIMES LIVE IN THE DESERT
THEY'RE BOTH PART OF THE EARTHS ECOSYSTEM
UH TRAIN
ALL OF THE VEINS THE LUNGS AND THE HEART
THE TUNDRA WHAT I SEE IS A SNOW HAIR A COYOTE SNOW OWLS A RAT LITTLE DROPPLINGS AND GRASS SOMETIMES GRASS THE CERTAIN BACTERIA AND BUGS WITH HUNTERS
ALL OF THE LITTLE PARTS IN THE CAR
IT HAS TO DO BECAUSE OF ALL THE LITTLE SUBSYSTEMS IN THIS BODY
BECAUSE THE WHEELS AND THE AXLE ARE UM BOTH PART OF THE SYSTEM TO MAKE THE CAR ROLL
ALL THE PARTS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH EACH OTHER UM YOU THEY CONNECT TO MAKE THE EARTH MOVE AND SPIN AROUND AND HELP ALL THE AIR THE AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE THE CARBON DIOXIDE WILL GO AWAY AND NEW AIR WILL POP OUT OF THE TREES AND IT HELPS US TO BREATHE
UH WHAT I NOTICE IS THAT THE RED IS POSSIBLE C O TWO AND THE BLUE IT CAN BE LIKE WHAT THEY EAT OR OR THEY CONSUME IT
IS ALL ABOUT LIKE WHAT THEY EAT AND HOW AND WHAT THEY KILL
I THINK THE BIOSPHERE'S ALL ABOUT THE ANIMALS WHERE THE ANIMALS LIVE LIKE THE WATER AND WHERE THE BIRDS LIVE IS THE TREES
I THINK WHAT WETLANDS AND DESERTS HAVE TO DO IS WHAT WHEN THEY LIVE THE ANIMALS LIVE AT A CERTAIN ECOSYSTEM THAT THEIR NATURAL HABITAT IS IN SO A LIZARD CAN LIVE IN THE DESERT AND A FISH CAN LIVE IN THE WETLANDS
THE LEAVES
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
I THINK THE VASCULAR SYSTEM LABELS ALL OF THE THINGS
THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT BY THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES LIKE THE PALMATE HAS FIVE MEANS FIVE FINGERS PALMATE IS WHAT IS IT WHAT IS LIKE A FEATHER
ONE TUBE GOES UP THE OTHER TUBE GOES DOWN
PALMATE
THAT IT'S A PALMATE
IT HAS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LEAVES AND HOW THEY WORK AROUND WITH THEIR CELLS INSIDE OF THEM
BYE BYE SEE YOU NEXT TIME
I NOTICED THAT THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES
I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
PALMATE PALMATE AND PARALLEL
THE LEAVES
PINNATE PALMATE AND ANOTHER ONE
THEY ALL FEEL DIFFERENT
THEIR PATTERNS ARE DIFFERENT BY THE EACH SIDES OF THE LEAF
THAT THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES ON THEM LIKE THE PALMATE HAS FIVE LIKE ON YOUR HANDS LIKE YOU HAVE FIVE FINGERS
TO HOLD THE LEAF TOGETHER
WHAT DOES WHAT MEAN
<DISCARD>
HOW SOME LEAVES ARE DIFFERENT THAN OTHERS
THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
IT'S ALL ABOUT EVAPORATING
IT HAS TO DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BY THE LEAVES THEY TRY TO EVAPORATE OUT OF THE BAG BUT ALL THE WATER JUST COMES OFF THE LEAVES AND GETS STUCK TO THE TOP
ALL OF THE HUMAN BODY CELLS
THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SIEVE AND THE STONES STAYED ON TOP
I DON'T KNOW MARNI
MAGNETISM AND A SIEVE
OKAY
(())
THAT THE MIXTURE CAN ONLY BE THAT THE SOLUTION CAN ONLY BE SEPARATED WITH THE EVAPORATION
I DON'T KNOW
BOTH
THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE COFFEE FILTER AND THE SAND STAYED ON TOP BECAUSE THE SAND IS BIGGER THAN THE COFFEE FILTER
THE PROPERTY
NO
BECAUSE OUT OF EVERYTHING ONLY WATER CAN PASS THROUGH THE FILTER
PROPERTIES OF
BECAUSE SOME MIXTURES HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES
EVAPORATION
I THINK WE USE THE SIEVE BECAUSE THE WATER GOES (()) THAN THE HOLES IN THE SIEVE THE ROCKS ARE LARGER
I DON'T KNOW
NO
MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
TAKE THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE SAND THE SAND WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET
I'M GOOD
THE SOLIDS AND IT SHARE A DIFFERENT PROPERTY
THE PAPER CLIPS UM STUCK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY ARE MAGNETIZED
THE MAGNET IS PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIPS FROM THE MIXTURE
YOU ARE PUTTING THE POWDER INTO THE WATER
WELL WE JUST HAD SCIENCE AND WE LEARNED HOW TO SEPARATE WELL NOT REALLY WE JUST LEARNED HOW TO KIND OF HOW TO WEIGH EACH SOLUTIONS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH EACH ONE HOW CONCENTRATED EACH ONE IS
I'M GOOD MARNEY HOW ARE YOU
UM ON THE FOURTH SCOOP THE WATER BECAME SATURATED OR THE SOLUTION BECAME SATURATED AND YOU COULDN'T PUT ANY MORE SOLUTE IN IT
WELL THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THE SOLUTION UM PARTS HAVE DISSOLVED
THE SOLUTION IS BECOMING SATURATED
I DON'T KNOW
IT'S BECOMING UM SATURATED
IT'S SHOWING THAT THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS
GOOD HOW ARE YOU MARNI
I BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU'VE DONE YOU'VE MADE A SUPER SATURATED SOLUTION I BELIEVE
WELL UH THEY HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE BECAUSE SALT IS A SOLUTE AND WATER IS A SOLVENT AND WHEN YOU MIX THEM TOGETHER YOU GET A SOLUTION
<NO_SIGNAL>
THAT'S ACTUALLY EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN ADDING SALT TO FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND SEEING HOW SATURATED IT WOULD GET
THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
WELL FIRST OF ALL A SOLUTION IS A SUBSTANCE IN WHICH ONE OF THE MATERIALS DISSOLVES INTO ANOTHER SO HOW YOU MAKE THEM IS YOU TAKE A SOLVENT AND A SOLUTE AND MIX THEM TOGETHER
WELL IT'S SHOWING THAT UM BOTH OF THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER UM THEY BOTH HAVE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER IN THEM BUT THE VARIABLE HERE IS THAT ONE IS A SALT SOLUTION AND THE OTHER ONE IS JUST PLAIN WATER
THEY HAVE TO ALL BE SATURATED
WE FIGURED THIS OUT BY WEIGHING
THAT MEANS IT'S SATURATED
IT UM BECOMES SATURATED
THAT MEANS THAT THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
I THINK IT MEANS THAT UM I'M NOT SURE
WE BEEN DOING A LOT OF MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
BECAUSE ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE THEREFORE MAKING THE ONE WITH TWENTY GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE HEAVIER BECAUSE IT HAS MORE THINGS IN IT
I WAS RIGHT WITH MY PREDICTION MARNEY BUT I MEAN WHAT DID YOU EXPECT I'M ME ANYWAY I SAW THAT THE ONE THAT HAD TWENTY GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE WAS HEAVIER THAN THE ONE THAT HAD TEN GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE
I'M THINKING THAT THE ONE THAT HAS THE MOST SOLUTE IN IT WILL BE HEAVIER BECAUSE IT HAS MORE GRAMS OR MILLILITERS OF THE MATERIALS
WELL LAST TIME MARNEY YOU TAUGHT ME THAT IF YOU HAVE LESS POWDER IN A COOL AID DRINK IT IS GOING TO BE MORE DILUTED BUT IF YOU HAVE MORE POWDER IN THE COOL AID DRINK NO MATTER HOW MUCH WATER IS IN EACH ONE AS LONG AS IT'S THE SAME AMOUNT IT'S GONNA BE MORE FLAVORFUL AND STRONG AND THE SALT WATER SOLUTION IS JUST GONNA TASTE BAD EITHER WAY SO YEAH
ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE AND ANOTHER HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE
THE SALT WELL YOU CAN'T UNLESS YOU TASTE IT
ONE IS VERY HEAVY AND THREE IS NOT VERY HEAVY AND TWO IS KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
WELL THE SOLUTION ONE IS VERY CONCENTRATED SOLUTION THREE IS A LITTLE LESS BUT IT IS STILL MORE CONCENTRATED THAN SOLUTION TWO
YOU CAN DETERMINE THAT BY NUMBER ONE THE COLOR NUMBER TWO HOW MUCH WATER OR HOW MUCH POWDER YOU PUT IN AND THAT'S BASICALLY JUST IT YOU KNOW IT'S YEAH
NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
BYE MARNEY YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND
I'M GREAT MARNEY HOW ARE YOU I'M EXCITED TO START WORKING
WELL KIND OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS TRYING TO SEPARATE MIXTURES AND A LITTLE BIT OF SEPARATING SOLUTIONS IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING SO YEAH AND IT'S BEEN A LOT OF FUN MARNEY I REALLY LIKE
ONE OF THEM WELL THEY BOTH HAD SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT ONE OF THEM HAS TEN GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE LET'S SAY SALT IF YOU WILL AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF THE SOLUTE OR SALT
I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU JUST SAID CAN YOU KIND OF EXPLAIN THAT TO ME
WELL AND THE GRAPE DRINK MIX ONE CUP FARTHEST TO THE LEFT GOT IT RIGHT THIS TIME HAS A LOT LESS HAD A LOT LESS GRAPETASTIC DRINK MIX IN IT AND THE GRAPE JUICE FARTHEST ONTO THE RIGHT HAD A LOT MORE AND THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE HAD JUST THE RIGHT BALANCE AND THE SALT WATER SOLUTION YOU CAN'T TELL BUT WELL I'M GUESSING SINCE YOU CAN'T TELL IT IT COULD BE ANYTHING REALLY BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T SEE IT BUT
WELL IN THIS PICTURE YOU CAN TELL THAT THE FEATHER IS MUCH LIGHTER THAN THE ROCK BY ACTUALLY ABOUT NINETY EIGHT GRAMS I MEAN SORRY NOT NINETY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT GRAMS AND THE ROCK IS EIGHTY EIGHT GRAMS HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER SO THE ROCK IS AT THE BOTTOM AND THE FEATHER IS AT THE TOP IT'S VERY INTERESTING
I THINK THE PAPER CLIPS WILL WORK BETTER
I BELIEVE IT IS THE SAND
I'M GREAT MARNI HOW ARE YOU
BECAUSE THE GRAVEL PARTICLES ARE BIGGER THAN THE HOLES IN THE SIEVE AND EVERYTHING HAS PARTICLES THAT ARE SMALLER THAN THE HOLES IN THE SIEVE SO THEY PASS THROUGH BUT THE GRAVEL DOES NOT SO THE GRAVEL IS SEPARATED FROM THE MIXTURE THEREFORE
I THINK IT'S THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE GRAVEL GRAVEL PARTICLES ARE SMALLER OR I MEAN SORRY BIGGER THAN THE HOLES IN THE SIEVE AND EVERYTHING PASSES THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S SMALLER
WELL BECAUSE SOMETIMES UM A CERTAIN TOOL WILL COME IN HANDY WITH A DIFFERENT WITH ONE MIXTURE BUT IT REALLY WON'T DO ANYTHING FOR ANOTHER MIXTURE
WELL ONE OF THE PROPERTIES IS PARTICLE SIZE ANOTHER ONE LET'S SEE THERE'S DENSITY AND THERE IS OTHER PROPERTIES SUCH AS SOMETHING ELSE
WELL THIS MIXTURE THE REASON WHY WE USE THE SIEVE IS BECAUSE THE PARTICLE SIZE OF THE GRAVEL WILL REALLY HELP US SEPARATE IT BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS BIGGER THAN THE HOLES IN THE SCREEN AND THE WATER THE WATER'S PARTICLES WILL PASS THROUGH THE SCREEN
WELL THE PAPER CLIPS ARE MAGNETIC SO THEY WILL COME OUT WITH THE MAGNET
WELL SOME OF THE MATERIALS IN THIS MIXTURE ARE UM MAGNETIC SO WE CAN USE THE MAGNET TO GET THEM OUT AND IT WILL REALLY HELP US SEPARATE IT
I THINK WE USE THE FILTER BECAUSE UM THE PARTICLE SIZE OF THE SAND IS BIGGER THAN THE PARTICLE THE HOLES IN THE FILTER
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT MARNI I DON'T REALLY GET IT
THE SALT IS THE ONE THAT WORKS FOR THIS BECAUSE THE WATER EVAPORATES FROM THE SALT MIXTURE AND IT LEAVES THE SALT CRYSTAL
IT IS TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE A MIXTURE OF GRAVEL AND WATER BY UM FILTERING THE WATER THROUGH THE SCREEN AND THE WATER WILL PASS THROUGH THE SCREEN BECAUSE THE PARTICLES ARE SMALLER THAN THE HOLES IN THE GRATE BUT THE GRAVEL IS BIGGER THAN THE HOLES IN THE GRATE ITS PARTICLES SO BASICALLY UM THEY'RE TRYING TO SHOW YOU UM HOW PARTICLE SIZE CAN REALLY HELP YOU IN SCIENCE
UM IN THIS PICTURE THEY ARE SEPARATING A MIXTURE OF GRAVEL AND WATER BY USING A SCREEN
WELL WE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO SEPARATE A MIXTURE I MEAN A SOLUTION AND YEAH
IT MEANS THAT WE ARE EVAPORATING OUT THE SOLUTE
UM THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN HERE IS PARTICLE SIZE AND HOW IT CAN REALLY HELP YOU SEPARATE MIXTURES
WELL UM I HAVE BEEN WELL TODAY THE EXPERIMENT THAT WE DID IN SCHOOL WAS WE TOOK A A MIXTURE OF MAGNETITE MAGNETITE POWDER GRAVEL AND SALT AND WE HAD TO SEPARATE THEM AND MAKE A (()) PROCEDURE AND IT WAS REALLY FUN I LIKE
WE CALL THEM TOOLS THAT WE USE TO SEPARATE MIXTURES I GUESS I'M NOT REALLY SURE MARNI I'M BAD AT SCIENCE
WELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS THAT THE SOLUTE IN A SOLUTION DISSOLVES INTO THE SOLVENT BUT A MIXTURE JUST STAYS AS IT AS IT IS AND NOTHING DISSOLVES AM I RIGHT I'M ALWAYS RIGHT
OH UM WELL THE SALT AND THE WATER IS A SOLUTION
THE SALAD IS A MIXTURE AND EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE WATER
WHAT IT'S DOING IS THE PARTICLE SIZE IS KIND OF KEY HERE AND THE SAND DOESN'T THE SAND DOESN'T GO THROUGH THE FILTER BECAUSE THE HOLES IN THE CUP OR THE FILTER ARE SMALLER THAN THE GRAINS OF SAND BUT THE WATER GOES THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S SMALL
GOOD BYE MARNI
WELL THE SALT IS THE PART OF THE MIXTURE THAT WILL DISSOLVE AND THE WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS KIND OF MIXTURE IS THAT IT DISSOLVES AND THAT'S A VERY UNIQUE KIND OF MIXTURE
IT'S DEFINITELY POSSIBLE BUT IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE GRAPETASTIC POWDER HAS DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER SO IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IT BACK
THE THEME HERE IS THAT WE'RE SEPARATING IT
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
WELL WHAT YOU DID IS YOU TOOK THE COFFEE FILTER AND YOU POURED THE MIXTURE OF SALT AND WATER I MEAN SAND AND WATER INTO THE COFFEE FILTER AND IT FILTERED THROUGH AND SAND STAYED IN THE FILTER AND WATER CAME OUT
UM THE SALAD IS WELL THE SALAD IS KIND OF WAVY AND THE TRAIL MIX IS IT LOOKS VERY CRUNCHY
ON THE LEFT IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE IT WAS SEPARATED AND THE PILE ON THE RIGHT IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE AFTER IT WAS SEPARATE
SOLID MATERIAL IS THE SOLUTE
THE TRAIL MIX IS BEING SEPARATED IN THIS ANIMATION
WELL THERE'S SALAD THERE IS TRAIL MIX THERE IS A MIXTURE OF PAPER CLIPS AND SOMETHING ELSE OR WOOD CHIPS AND THEN THERE IS A MIXTURE OF WATER AND MARBLES
WE KNOW THAT IT IS DEFINITELY VERY POSSIBLE TO GET BACK A SOLVENT FROM THE SOLUTION AND BUT IT IS SOMETIMES EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND SOMETIMES IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR INSTANCE WITH SALT AND WATER UM YOU HAVE TO UM EVAPORATE THE WATER FROM THE MIXTURE SO THAT YOU GET THE SALT
THE WATER WENT THROUGH THE SCREEN AND THE MARBLES STAYED ON THE TOP
SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE WATER AND THE MARBLES BY BECAUSE THE MARBLES ARE BIGGER THAN THE HOLES IN THE SCREEN AND THE WATER IS PASSING THROUGH
ARE BEING SEPARATED IN A VERY CONVENIENT WAY
SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S BEING SEPARATED
TRAIL MIX GETS SEPARATED AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S SEPARATE
THE SOLUTE I BELIEVE IS THE ONE THAT DISSOLVES
GREAT
BEING SEPARATED
THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
THAT IS A MIXTURE AND THAT THAT'S WHAT WE CALL IT AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT IS WITHOUT MIXTURES WE WOULDN'T HAVE TRAIL MIX
WHEN ONE OBJECT DISSOLVES INTO ANOTHER OBJECT IT IS CALLED A SOLUTION WITH A SOLUTE AND A SOLVENT AND SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THAT'S AN EXAMPLE
SALT IS A MIXTURE THAT WILL EVENTUALLY SETTLE OUT THE SALT AND THE WATER IS A SOLUTE AND A SOLUTE AND SOLUTION AND A AND THE WOOD CHIPS AND A AND THE WOOD CHIPS AND PAPER CLIPS ARE A MIXTURE
WELL WHEN YOU MIX SAND AND WATER IT FLOATS AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT AND THEN IT SETTLES OUT WITH ONE LAYER OF WATER ON THE TOP ONE LAYER OF SAND ON THE BOTTOM AND WITH THE SALT THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND WITH THE WOOD CHIP CLIPS THEY JUST STAY MIXED CAUSE NOTHING REALLY HAPPENS CAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY WATER AND NONE OF THEM
ALL OF THEM ARE MIXTURES
SEPARATING SOLUTIONS
THOSE ARE THE MATERIALS TO MAKE A SOLUTION
I THINK THAT THE CITRIC ACID IS IN THE MIDDLE ONE
EPSOM SALT
ONE IS A CITRIC ACID SOLUTION AND ONE IS AN EPSOM SALT SOLUTION SO YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM ON PETRI DISHES AND UM MAKE THEM EVAPORATE
UH YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT
SUBSTANCE C IS SALT OR I MEAN YEAH
YOU CAN SEE UM WHAT CRYSTALS WHAT IDENTIFICATION THEY MATCH AND THAT UM YOU CAN TELL YOU WHAT TYPE OF CRYSTAL IT IS AND THEREFORE WHAT WAS WHAT THE MYSTERY SOLUTION WAS AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING
WELL THOSE ARE THE SALT CRYSTALS OR THE SOLUTE CRYSTALS IN THE PETRI DISHES AND IT SHOWS THAT THE CITRIC ACID HAS FEATHERY FLAT CLEAR WHITE CRYSTALS THE EPSOM SALT HAS SPIKY NEEDLE LIKE CLEAR WHITE CRYSTALS AND THE SALT HAS SQUARE CLEAR WHITE CRYSTALS
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
THE EPSOM SALT
THE SALT IS DISSOLVED IN THE WATER BECAUSE IT HAS SQUARE CLEAR WHITE CRYSTALS
THAT'S HOW YOU WEIGH A SOLUTION
THE SUBSTANCE C WEIGHS JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THE OTHER ONE BECAUSE IT'S NOT PURE WATER IT HAS SOMETHING ELSE IN IT TOO
THAT'S HOW MUCH THE SOLUTION WEIGHS FOR EXAMPLE THE CITRIC ACID WEIGHS SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS THE EPSOM SALT SOLUTION WEIGHS FORTY GRAMS AND THE SUGAR SOLUTION WEIGHS ONE HUNDRED GRAMS
I THINK THAT IT'S THE UM THE EPSOM SALT BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE CRYSTALS ARE SPIKY AND NEEDLE LIKE AND THEY'RE CLEAR WHITE
SUBSTANCE THREE IS THE ONE THAT WOULD TAKE MORE
EPSOM SALT
I'M GOOD MARNI HOW ARE YOU
THEY'RE MAKING A SOLUTION
BECAUSE THE UM CITRIC ACID JUST DISSOLVES A LOT FASTER THAN THE SUGAR OR MAYBE IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND
THAT'S ACTUALLY EXACTLY WHAT WE USED IN SCIENCE IT'S A SOLUBILITY CHART AND IT MEASURES UM HOW MUCH HOW MANY GRAMS IT UM YOU NEED TO SATURATED THAT FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER SO YEAH
WELL THE REACTANTS AND THE PRODUCTS THE REACTANT WAS THE UM CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND THE BAKING SODA AND THE PRODUCT WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION
UM A CHEMICAL REACTION OCCURRED
THE REACTANT WERE BAKING SODA CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND THE PRODUCE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION AND A UM PRODUCT
BECAUSE THE WEIGHT OF ALL THE CARBON BUBBLES IS STILL IN THE CLOSED BAG SO IT ADDS TO IT'S MASS WHEREAS THE OPEN BAG DOESN'T HAVE ANY CARBON BUBBLE WEIGHT IN IT SO IT STAYS UM IT'S LIGHTER
UM A CHEMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE AND WHEN THE REACTION IS DONE THE POWDER SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
IN THIS ANIMATION UM THEY ARE THEY PUT SALT INTO A UM THING AND UM THEY UM EVAPORATED THE THE WATER FROM THE SOLUTION AND THEY LEFT SQUARE CRYSTALS BEHIND
IT SEEMS THAT WHEN THE BAG WAS OPEN IT DIDN'T PUFF UP BUT WHEN IT WAS CLOSED IT DID PUFF UP AND THE UM AND THE MASS OF IT CHANGED BECAUSE THE CLOSED ONE STILL HAS ALL THOSE CARBON BUBBLES WEIGHED IN THERE AND THE OPEN ONE DOES NOT HAVE ANY CARBON BUBBLES WEIGH IN IT BECAUSE THE CARBON BUBBLES ESCAPED INTO THE AIR
THEY CHANGED AND THE HIGHER THE ONE THAT HAS THE THE LARGER HEAVIER MASS IS THE ONE THAT IS CLOSED BECAUSE THE CARBON BUBBLES THAT UM TRIED TO ESCAPE FROM THE BAG DID NOT GET TO ESCAPE BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED AND SO THE WEIGHT OF ALL THOSE LITTLE CARBON BUBBLES IS STILL IN THAT BAG AND IT ADDS TO THE MASS WHEREAS THE THE ONE THAT HAS A LIGHTER MASS UM ALL THE CARBON BUBBLES GOT TO ESCAPE INTO THE AIR
THIS TELLS US THAT
WELL UM YESTERDAY WE UM WELL WE JUST KINDA WORKED WITH SOLUTIONS AND YEAH
THIS TELLS WHAT THE EVENTUAL MASS IT
I SEE THAT THERE IS A LAYER OF POWDERY WHITE FILM ON THE BOTTOM AND IT'S TILL FULL OF WATER
THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION
WE CAN SEE THAT THERE WAS NO REACTION BECAUSE THE UM IT DIDN'T BUBBLE OR FIZZ THE SOLUTION DID NOT BUBBLE OR FIZZ AT ALL AND IT LEFT BEHIND CRYSTALS
I'M OKAY MARNI
I BELIEVE THIS WAS FORMED I DON'T I DON'T REALLY GET THIS
I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS WHEN HE SEALED OR WHOEVER IS DOING THE EXPERIMENT SEALED THE BAG THE BUBBLES THE CARBON BUBBLES THAT WERE FORMED BY THE CHEMICAL REACTION COULD NOT GET OUT AND IT MADE THE BAG PUFF UP TO ACCOMMODATE FOR ALL OF THOSE CARBON BUBBLES
<NOISE>
THAT THE LIGHTER COLORED SOLUTIONS ARE MORE DILUTED IF YOU WILL THAN THE DARKER COLORED ONES
WELL WHATEVER THE POWDER TASTES LIKE IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE VERY STRONG AND THE MORE POWDER YOU PUT IN TO THE WATER THE FLAVOR IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE STRONGER AND THE LESS POWDER THE MORE DILUTED THE TASTE IS
WELL MARNEY IF YOU ADD MORE WATER TO THE DRINK IT WILL BE MORE BLAND AND MORE DILUTED AND LESS CONCENTRATED THAN THE OTHER DRINK THAT HAS LESS WATER
IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE A LOT MORE BLAND AND A LOT MORE TASTELESS THAN THE REALLY CONCENTRATED ONE
HI MARNEY YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND
WELL WE HAVEN'T HAD SCIENCE YET TODAY BUT WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TO SEPARATE SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
WELL IT'S NOT AS CONCENTRATED AND IT HAS MORE POWDER IN IT TRAIL MIX
I CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE MORE POWDER AND ARE MORE CONCENTRATED
WELL IF THERE IS MORE WATER IN THE SOLUTION IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE MORE WATER TASTING IF YOU WILL AND A LOT MORE BLAND AND THE ONE THAT HAS LESS WATER IN IT EVEN IF IT DOES HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF POWDER AS THE OTHER THE OTHER MIX WITH THE MOST WATER IS PROBABLY IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE A LOT MORE FLAVORFUL AND STRONG AND
WELL THE DEFINITION OF A SOLUTION IS A IS ONE MATERIAL DISSOLVES INTO THE OTHER AND SO THE SOLVENT DISSOLVES INTO THE SOLUTE AND THAT IS WHAT A SOLUTION IS AND HOW THEY WORK IS THAT WHEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER IT CREATES A SOLUTION LIKE SALT WATER
GREAT MARNEY HOW ARE YOU
IT'S PROBABLY GONNA TASTE REALLY GROSS AND JUST REALLY DISGUSTING AND JUST REALLY (()) REALLY GROSS
WELL THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE POWDER THAN THE ONE ON THE I MEAN SORRY THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE POWDER THAN THE ONE ON THE
IF THE COLOR IS BRIGHTER THAN THE AND THE OTHER THINGS ARE
WELL MARNEY THE DARK COLORED SOLUTIONS HAVE A LOT MORE POWDER IN THEM
IT'S PROBABLY GONNA TASTE PRETTY BLAND COMPARED TO THE OTHER SOLUTION BUT IT IT MIGHT TASTE A LITTLE BIT BETTER
WELL IF THERE IS MORE POWDER CRYSTALS IF YOU WILL IN THE WATER THEN YOU CAN TELL THAT IT HAS A HIGHER CONCENTRATION I THINK BUT I MIGHT BE WRONG I THINK I'M WRONG BUT I MIGHT BE WRONG NO I THINK
WELL THE ONE ON THE LEFT WHICH HAS MORE POWDER IN IT HAS MORE IS MORE PURPLE AND IT'S MORE PURPLE AND IT'S A BRIGHTER PURPLE AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS PURPLE IN IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH POWDER
<NOISE>
ONE OF THE CUPS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT HAS A LOT MORE GRAPETASTIC POWDER IN IT
BYE MARNI
YES I AM
NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
WELL FIRST THE ROCK IS NINETY GRAMS WHICH IS MUCH HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER WHICH IS TWO GRAMS SO THE ROCK IS HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER
WELL THERE'S MANY WAYS YOU CAN FIND OUT UM IF IT'S COLORED YOU CAN TELL BY IT'S COLORED IF IT'S LIKE A REALLY DEEP BLUE OR LIKE A BLIGHT BLUE AND UM BUT THE NUMBER ONE WAY YOU CAN FIND THAT OUT IS BY WEIGHING IT AND THE HEAVIEST ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
ONE HAS MORE UM SOLUTE AND ONE HAS LESS SOLUTE
NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
I'M GREAT MARNI HOW ARE YOU
WELL THE WATER THE MILLILITER AMOUNT OF WATER IS THE SAME BUT ONE OF THEM THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS TEN GRAMS OF IT'S SOLUTE AND THE OTHER ONE HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF IT'S SOLUTE SO YES THAT'S IT
WELL YOU IF YOU WEIGH THEM YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT HI OH
TODAY MARNI WE LEARNED HOW TO FIND OUT HOW CONCENTRATED OR DILUTE A SOLUTION IS BY WEIGHING THEM
NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS THE MOST DILUTE AND NUMBER IS IN THE
I THINK THE ONE UM ON THE RIGHT THE TWENTY GRAM ONE WILL BE HEAVIER AND MORE CONCENTRATED THEREFORE
WELL IN THE GRAPE DRINK MIX PICTURE UM THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS VERY DILUTE THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS VERY IN THE MIDDLE IF YOU WILL AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS VERY CONCENTRATED AND SAME WITH THE SALT WELL YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL WITH THE SALT WATER SOLUTION
C IS THE MOST DILUTE AND B IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
MY PREDICTION WAS RIGHT MARNI BECAUSE THE TWENTY GRAM SOLUTE SOLUTION WAS HEAVIER THAN THE TEN GRAM SOLUTE SOLUTION
IT WILL FLOAT
I AM WELL MARNEY HOW ARE YOU
THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE PENNY
IT'S A LOT OF FUN AND WE JUST TODAY DID IN SCIENCE HOW TO TELL IF SALT WATER IS
THE PENNY IS HEAVIER THAN THE CORK
THAT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE
ACTUALLY THERE IS A REACTION BECAUSE THE BUBBLES ARE COMING TO THE TOP
SOLVENT
IT BUBBLED UP AND FIZZED A LOT
THERE IS NO CHEMICAL REACTION I DON'T THINK BECAUSE IS REACTING IT'S JUST RUSTING
A CHEMICAL REACTION IS HAPPENING
I'M NOT QUITE SURE
THE FINAL PRODUCT TURNED PINK
THE THE BUBBLES IN THE CARBONATED WATER ARE CARBON BUBBLES
I'M JUST GONNA TAKE A WILD GUESS I THINK IT'S A REACTANT
THEY BUBBLE
<NO_SIGNAL>
IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF NO CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS BUBBLING OR
THEY'RE MIXING SODIUM HYDROXIDE WITH (())
THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE FOR THE SODIUM HYDROXIDE IS THAT THEY ARE LITTLE WHITE MOLECULES THAT ARE VERY EVEN AND LINED UP AND THE HYDROCHLORIC ACID MOLECULAR STRUCTURE IS KIND OF EVERYWHERE AND THEN THE WATER'S IS JUST KIND OF EVERYWHERE AS WELL BUT THE PRODUCT IS ALSO EVERYWHERE BUT IT'S DIFFERENT COLORS
THAT IS NOT A CHEMICAL REACTION IT'S A SOLUTION BECAUSE NOTHING IS REACTING IT'S JUST DISSOLVING
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN
UM FIRST IT WAS THE MOLECULES WERE ALL BLUE AND THEN THEY TURNED PURPLE A A FEW OF THEM TURNED PURPLE
THE WATER BECAUSE IT TURNED INTO GAS
NO
NO THEY CAN'T BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE PART OF A NEW SOLUTION OR CHEMICAL REACTION THING
THEY DO A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE UM THE VINEGAR HAS BLUE AND YELLOW MOLECULES AND THE BAKING SODA HAS WHITE MOLECULES AND THE PRODUCT HAS GREY BLUE AND YELLOWISH WHITE MOLECULES
WE CALL IT A PRODUCT
WELL WE'VE JUST KINDA BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING SOLUTIONS AND MIXTURES
ON SECOND THOUGHT NO THERE IS NO REACTION BECAUSE IT'S NOT REACTING
THEY'RE GOING TO CREATE A CHEMICAL REACTION BY MIXING BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE WITH WATER
I'M DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU
THAT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT MAKES THE PRODUCT TURN PINK
THERE'S SOME LITTLE WHITE STUFF ON THEY BOTTOM
IT BUBBLED UP AND CREATED A GAS
A CHEMICAL REACTION IS HAPPENING THAT'S CAUSING THEM TO GLOW AND WHEN YOU BEND IT UM ACTIVATES THE REACTION AND IT GLOWS
I THINK SO BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF WEIRD STUFF ON THE BOTTOM
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CHEMICAL REACTION IS CAUSING IT TO GLOW
REACTANTS
THERE'S DEFINITELY A REACTION HAPPENING BECAUSE IT'S BUBBLING AND FIZZING
THERE'S NOT A CHEMICAL REACTION THIS IS JUST CONDENSATION UM WHEN THE ICE IS DROPPED INTO THE WATER IT MAKES IT COLD AND THAT MAKES THE GLASS SWEAT
IT TURNS INTO A GAS
(())
THE FACT THAT IT CHANGES
CHEMICAL REACTION
(()) COLORS
YOU TOO MARNI GOOD BYE
IT'S A UM THEY'RE A MIX OF ALL OF THE REACTANTS
THEY REACTED
IT MEANS THAT THEY WERE BOTH COMBINED
THERE'S NO REACTION BECAUSE IT'S NOT MIXING ANYTHING IT'S JUST THAT THE CARBON AND THE CARBONATED WATER BUBBLES ARE COMING UP TO THE TOP
IT'S RUSTING BECAUSE THE WATER IS SOAKING INTO IT'S BONES
THEY LOOK VERY FOGGY
ACTUALLY THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE SOMETHING IS HAPPENING TO THE BIKE
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE SPECIAL SOLUTION IS
THE SALT SOLUTION IS HEAVIER BECAUSE IT HAS SALT IN IT AND THE OTHER ONE JUST HAS WATER
THE UH I MEAN WE'VE BEEN YESTERDAY LIKE I TOLD YOU WE'VE BEEN DOING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND HOW TO TELL THE MASS OF THEM ESPECIALLY IN ONES WHERE YOU CAN'T SEE
IT'S DISSOLVING
BY DOING THE GRAM ADDING
WELL THE MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR A SOLUTION IS A SOLUTE AND A SOLVENT AND FOR A SOLUTION TO BE MADE THE SOLVENT MUST DISSOLVE INTO THE SOLUTE
SOME OF THE SALT SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
ALL OF IT DISSOLVED
WELL THE WATER HAS NOT DISSOLVED ALL OF THE SALT IT'S NOT COMPLETELY SATURATED
THAT JUST MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED
THEY BOTH HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLVENT AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF SOLUTE OF AS EACH OTHER
WELL THE SALT IS THE SOLVENT AND THE WATER'S THE SOLUTE AND THE SCOOP IS HOW YOU GET THE SALT INTO THE WATER
THAT MEANS THAT IT HASN'T DISSOLVED YET
THAT JUST MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE SALT HAS DISSOLVED YET
WELL THERE WAS MORE SALT IN IT SO IT NEEDED MORE
I'M OKAY I'M ON CRUTCHES BUT I'M GOOD
THAT'S ACTUALLY EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE HAD THE UM THE GRAM SCOOPS AND WE PUT THE SALT IN IT AND PUT IT IN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER
THE EPSOM SALT HAS ALL DISSOLVED
THEY'RE PUTTING THE EPSOM SALT INTO THE WATER AND SOME OF IT IS DISSOLVING AND SOME OF IT IS SINKING TO THE BOTTOM
I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT YOU MEAN BY A PROPERTY OF IT
WELL ONE WAY TO SEPARATE FOR EXAMPLE A SOLUTION LIKE SALT AND WATER IS TO PUT THEM INTO PETRIE DISHES AND EVAPORATE THE WATER FROM THE SALT AND THAT WILL LEAVE ONLY THE SOLVENT
THE EPSOM SALT WAS FILTERED WELL
HOW ARE YOU MARNEY
IT'S CALLED EVAPORATION MARNEY AND WHAT HAPPENS IS IT TURNS INTO WATER VAPOR AND IT GOES UP INTO THE SKY BUT SINCE THE SALT IS NOT A LIQUID IT DOES NOT EVAPORATE IT JUST STAYS THERE AND TURNS INTO SALT CRYSTALS
I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT I BELIEVE THE SOLUTE IS THE LIQUID OR THE
CONSIDERED A SOLUTION MARNEY
THE THING THAT DISSOLVES INTO THE SOLUTE IS THE SOLVENT
WELL THE MASS OF ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING INTO THE MIXTURE IS ALSO ADDING UP THEIR MASS SO TWENTY PLUS TWENTY PLUS TEN IS FIFTY SO YEAH
WELL THE SIGNIFICANCE THE CLOCK HAS IS THAT THINGS DON'T JUST EVAPORATE RIGHT AWAY IT TAKES SOME TIME AND IT'S SHOWING THAT TIME IS PASSING BEFORE IT IS EVAPORATING RIGHT MARNEY
GOOD BYE YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND
WELL THE WATER OR THE SOLVENT IS THE ONE THAT IS DOING THE DISSOLVING AND IT DISSOLVES THE SALT TO MAKE THE SOLUTION AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT YOU CAN'T HAVE IT WITHOUT
WELL TODAY IN SCIENCE CLASS WE DID A EXPERIMENT WHERE WE HAD A MIXTURE OF MAGNETITE GRAVEL SAND OR NOT SAND POWDER AND SALT AND WE HAD TO GET IT BACK GET SEPARATE THEM AND GET THEM ALL BACK
WELL LET'S THINK THE SALT IS THE SOLVENT AND THE WATER IS THE SOLUTE IN THIS PICTURE AND IT WHEN THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER THEY CREATE A SOLUTION
YES YOU CAN
THIS ANIMATION SHOWS A MIXTURE BECAUSE THE SALT DID NOT DISSOLVE INTO THE MIXTURE AND THEY GOT IT AND IT'S THEY GOT IT OUT WITH THE COFFEE FILTER
THE WATER IS EVAPORATING MARNEY YOU JUST CLICK WELL IT YOU STILL HAVE TO SAY IT BUT IF YOU CAN CLICK IT WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING
IN THIS ANIMATION THEY ARE MIXING FLOUR AND WATER AND THEN THEY ARE TAKING A COFFEE FILTER AND FILTERING THE THE MIXTURE THROUGH THE COFFEE FILTER AND THE FLOUR CAME OUT AND THE WATER FILTERED THROUGH
WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS THE WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN THE ANIMATION IS THEY'RE WEIGHING THE SALT WATER AND THEY FIGURE OUT THAT IT IS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS AND THEY DID THIS BY PUTTING IT ON THE SCALE AND PUTTING IN SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO SEPARATE THE COMPONENTS OF A SOLUTION BUT ONE OF THE WAYS IS TO TAKE A COFFEE FILTER AND FILTER IT THROUGH AND SOME OF AND THE SOLVENT WILL GO THROUGH AND THE SOLUTE WILL
THAT BACK IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
I BELIEVE IT IS A MIXTURE
THE SOLUTE
THE WATER IS EVAPORATING AND LEAVING THE SALT BEHIND
I BELIEVE THE NAME FOR THE WATER IS THE SOLVENT
THAT THIS IS A SOLUTION BECAUSE THE CITRIC ACID DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS
PARDON ME MARNEY CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
WELL WHEN YOU MIX THE THINGS YOU ARE ALSO MIXING THEIR WEIGHT OR THEIR MASS SO FIFTY GRAMS PLUS FIFTEEN GRAMS IS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
WELL THAT SO THE EPSOM SALT WAS PUT INTO THE MIXTURE BUT IT WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER SO THEY CAN'T GET IT OUT
WELL THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER IS NOT A SOLUTION
I'M JUST GUESSING BUT IS IT EQUIVALENCY
THAT THE MASS OF PART OF THE MIXTURE IS BEING ADDED UP AND PUT INTO THE FINAL RESULT
WELL THE MIXED END RESULT IS FIFTY GRAMS BECAUSE THE PEANUTS ARE TWENTY GRAMS PLUS THE RAISINS WHICH ARE ANOTHER TWENTY GRAMS IS FORTY GRAMS PLUS THE CANDY WHICH IS TEN GRAMS WE'LL GET FIFTY GRAMS BECAUSE WE'VE MIXED THEM ALL TOGETHER AND THAT'S WHY MARNEY
<SILENCE>
WELL THE SALT WATER OR THE END RESULT IS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS BECAUSE THE WATER BECAUSE IT'S A MIXTURE OF THE WATER AND THE SALT AND THE WATER IS FIFTY GRAMS AND THE SALT IS FIFTEEN GRAMS SO WHEN YOU ADD THAT TOGETHER YOU GET SIXTY FIVE GRAMS WHEN YOU MAKE THE SALT WATER
WHEN THE RESULT IS THE SAME AS THE STUFF GOING IN WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE MASS HAS BEEN ADDED TOGETHER TO MAKE THE RESULT
THAT TELLS US THAT IT IS A MIXTURE AND NOT A SOLUTION
IT IS TRYING TO MAKE A POINT THAT WHEN YOU MIX SAND AND WATER IT WILL THE SAND WILL NOT DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER IT WILL JUST STAY THERE AND BUT WHEN YOU MIX SALT AND WATER THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
WATER IS WELL WATER IS REQUIRED BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT EVAPORATES IN A SOLUTION AND IT LEAVES THE SALT BEHIND BECAUSE THE SALT IS NOT A LIQUID
THE THEY ARE PUTTING THE SALT WATER INTO A SHALLOW DISH AND THE WATER IS EVAPORATING FROM THE SOLUTION TO MAKE MINIATURE SALT CRYSTAL
I THINK IT IS SHOWING US WELL I GUESS IT'S SHOWING US SOME WHAT BEES DO TO GET OTHER BEES TO COME AND HARVEST FROM THESE FLOWERS SO THAT THEY CAN WORK ON BUILDING THEIR HIVES
LIKE I JUST SAID HE HE GOT WORRIED WHEN HE SAW THE JUICE SPILLING OVER SO HE STOOD UP AND GOT ALL SURPRISED
THE MAN GOT TICKLED SO HE AND HE SAW THE STIMULUS OR THE MOSQUITO AND SO HE SMACKED IT
I THINK THAT IS THE OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THE SYSTEM THAT YOU USE SO THAT IN CASE LIKE IF YOU GET TICKLED OR SURPRISED IT IT IT MAKES YOU JUMP OR REACT IN SOME BIG WAY SO THAT YOU CAN'T YOU WON'T GET HURT OR ANYTHING
THE JUICE FALLING OVER IS A STIMULUS TO THE KID BECAUSE HE GOT WORRIED AND JUICE SPLATTERED ALL OVER HIM SO HE STOOD UP AND LIKE GOT ALL SURPRISED
SO WE LOOKED AT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU YOU REACT TO SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THE DOOR BELL AND LIKE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND HOW YOU NEED YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO REACT TO ANYTHING YOU'D JUST SIT THERE WITH A STRAIGHT FACE NOT DOING ANYTHING AT ALL
THE RATTLE SNAKES RATTLE
WELL YESTERDAY WE LOOKED AT OUR GRASS THAT WE'VE BEEN GROWING AND WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS LIKE THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM A COUPLE OF OTHER SYSTEMS
I SEE A SNAKE REACTING TO AN ANIMAL TRYING TO WARN IT THAT IT DOESN'T WANT TO COME NEAR THE SNAKE BECAUSE THE SNAKE WILL EAT IT IF IT COMES NEAR IT BECAUSE THE SNAKE DOESN'T WANT TO BE BOTHERED
WELL THE MAN GOT A STIMULUS BECAUSE OF THE DOOR BELL THE DOOR BELL IS THE MAN STIMULUS BECAUSE HE GOT ALL SURPRISED AND HIS HEART RACED AND HE WOKE UP AND KIND OF JUMPED OUT OF HIS SEAT REALLY FAST
IT HELPS ALL THE BEES FIND WHERE THE NECTAR IS SO THAT THEY CAN ALL GET THE FOOD FOR THE BEE HIVE
IT'S SHOWING DIFFERENT ANIMALS WHICH ALL HAVE SYSTEMS
THE MAN IS REACTING TO THE TICKLE ON HIS HAND FROM THE BUG LANDING ON IT AND SO HE JUST SMACKS THE BACK OF HIS HAND SO THAT THE COULD KILL THE BUG
THE DOG REACTS TO THE DOOR BELL BECAUSE IT GETS SCARES SO IT STARTS TO BARK AND IT WANTS TO PROTECT ITS TERRITORY SO IT BARKS IT DOES IT LIFTS UP ITS TAIL AND MAKES ITSELF LOOK BIGGER TO SCARE AWAY ANYTHING THAT SEEMS LIKE A THREAT TO IT'S TERRITORY
<DISCARD>
HELPS YOU TO REACT TO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE IN THIS PICTURE THE BALL IS COMING TOWARDS HER SO AND SHE SEES IT SO HER NERVOUS SYSTEM IS TELLING HER EXACTLY WHEN SHE NEEDS TO HIT TO SWING THE BAT SO THAT SHE HITS THE BALL
IT IS THE SPINAL CORD THE BRAIN AND THE HUMAN NERVES THAT ARE ALL THROUGHOUT THE BODY
THEY ARE ALL DOING WHAT ANY ANIMAL WOULD NORMALLY DO AND IT LOOKS LIKE THAT ONE DOG IN THE TOP LEFT IS IN THE SAME ROOM AS THE MAN IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT
THE BRAIN SENDS IT SENDS THE ENTIRE REACTION THROUGHOUT YOUR BODY SO YOUR BODY KNOWS WHAT TO DO SO LIKE WHEN YOU GET SCARED YOUR BRAIN TELLS YOU TO REACT AND MAKES YOU DO SOMETHING BIG LIKE JUMP OR FOR A DOG BARK LIKE (())
IT HELPS YOU GET FOOD DOWN INTO THE STOMACH SO THAT YOU CAN DIGEST THE FOOD
THEY'RE BOTH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CELLS BUT THE BUT WITH THE HUMAN IT'S A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CELLS IN ONE SYSTEM WITH THE YEAST IT'S A BUNCH OF IT IT'S A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CELLS IN A BUNCH OF SEPARATE SYSTEMS
HUMAN BECAUSE IT SHOWS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CELLS ON THE ONE ARM AND THE YEAST IS MADE UP OF JUST ONE CELL AND I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT THAT THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF CELLS AND THE YEAST IS MADE UP OF ONE
CELLS AND ORGANISMS AND SYSTEMS
(())
THAT ALL THOSE BIG BLUE PARTS ARE THE BRAIN CELLS THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED BY TINY TUBES AND THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF BRAIN CELLS IN THE BRAIN
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE MOUTH YOU'D CHOKE ON FOOD AND IT WOULDN'T GET THROUGH YOUR BODY CORRECTLY AND SO WITH THE MOUTH YOU'D GRIND FOOD UP WITH YOUR TEETH AND DISSOLVE IT SLIGHTLY WITH YOUR SALIVA NOT SALIVA I JUST SAID SALIVA WITH YOUR SPIT AND MAKE IT GO DOWN YOUR THROAT EASIER SO IT CAN WORK THROUGH YOUR
THAT THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF MANY DIFFERENT CELLS AND THE YEAST IS JUST MADE UP OF ONE CELL
THE HUMAN CELLS ARE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE PLANT CELLS THEY'RE JUST KIND OF DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY EACH BECAUSE WITH THE LEAF CELLS THEY'RE STICKING OUT AND ARE KIND OF LIKE BIG AND CUP SHAPED BUT WITH THE HUMANS THEY'RE JUST A BUNCH OF TINY LITTLE CIRCULAR CELLS
I THINK THAT'S YEAST WHICH IS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT YEAST CELLS WELL YEAST IS ACTUALLY ONE CELL ONE SYSTEM ONE ORGANISM
I THINK IT'S SHOWING US SOME OF THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN THE HUMAN'S BODY AND LIKE THERE'S THE INTESTINES THE STOMACH THE ESOPHAGUS AND EVEN THE ACTUALLY I THINK THAT'S IT
PINK MUSCLES IN IN THE LEG AND THEY'RE A BUNCH OF TINY PURPLE SPOTS ON THE MUSCLE
IT'S ONE BIG SYSTEM THEY ALL ALL OF THE SYSTEMS WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE YOUR BODY WORK SO THAT YOU CAN DIGEST FOOD AND MAKE IT COME OUT THE OTHER END PROPERLY
THOSE ARE ALL THE BRAIN CELLS IN THE BRAIN ORGANISM
THAT THEY ALL CONNECT TOGETHER TO MAKE THE WHOLE ARM WORK AS WITH THE SKIN ON IT OTHERWISE THE SKIN WOULD ALL JUST FALL OFF AND YOU WOULD HAVE A BIG NAKED SPOT ON YOUR ARM
IT'S A BUTTERFLY THAT IS
I SEE MANY DIFFERENT SKIN CELLS ALL OVER THE ARM LIKE TINY ONES AT THE TOP AND AND BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE MIDDLE AND THEN THERE ARE A BUNCH IN THE MIDDLE AND A COUPLE ON THE BOTTOM
THE HUMAN DIGESTIVE SYSTEM NEEDS A BUNCH OF PARTS LIKE THE MOUTH SO THAT IT CAN SHRED UP FOOD AND MAKE IT WET SO THAT IT CAN GET DOWN THE THROAT AND INTO THE STOMACH WHERE IT CAN DISSOLVE A BIT AND THEN THE ENERGY CAN GO INTO THE SMALL INTESTINE AND BIG INTESTINE TO MAKE ENERGY AND THEN THE OTHER BAD STUFF GOES OUT THE OTHER END
THEY NEED FOOD JUST LIKE US AND THEY THEIR CELLS NEED FOOD JUST LIKE OUR CELLS NEED FOOD SO IF WE EAT JUST LIKE THEY EAT THEY THEN WE WILL GET MORE ENERGY FROM THE CELLS COLLECTING ENERGY
THAT THE BIG SECTIONS ARE BRAIN CELLS
THE ORGANISMS AND SYSTEMS INSIDE OF OUR BODIES
THOSE ARE THE ORGANS WHICH ARE MADE UP OF CELLS THAT ARE INSIDE A HUMAN AND A BUTTERFLY AND LIKE A BUTTERFLY IT IT IT HAS SOME SIMILAR CELLS INTESTINES LIKE US LIKE THEY'VE ALSO GOT A STOMACH A
IT SEEMS LIKE KIND OF PINK WITH A BUNCH OF TINY PURPLE SPOTS AND THERE ARE LINES IN BETWEEN EACH PINK SECTION AND THE PURPLE DOTS ARE THERE ARE A COUPLE PURPLE DOTS BETWEEN THE PINK SECTIONS AND THERE ARE A COUPLE PURPLE DOTS IN EACH OF THE PINK SECTIONS
THE INTESTINES ARE WHAT YOU NEED SO THAT YOU CAN SO IT GET GATHER THE ENERGY FROM THE FOOD SO THAT YOU CAN RUN AROUND AND DO ALL THAT STUFF AND IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE INTESTINES YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET THE BAD STUFF OUT
<DISCARD>
IT UM IN SCIENCE WE HAVE TRIED PUTTING YEAST YEAST INTO A BAG AND MIXING IT WITH WATER SO THAT IT'S NONDORMANT AND THEN WE HAD PUT RANDOM THINGS IN IT LIKE SUGAR OR WHEAT OR AN ANIMAL CRACKER AND WHEN YOU PUT SUGAR IN IT IT MAKES IT BUBBLE UP BECAUSE THEY THEY LIKE SUGAR A LOT JUST LIKE HUMANS LIKE SUGAR OR MOST HUMANS
THAT THEY'RE KIND OF LARGE TUBES SORT OF THAT ARE LIKE REALLY PINK WITH A BUNCH OF TINY PURPLE DOTS SORT OF LIKE MOLECULES FLOATING AROUND THEM
WE BOTH HAVE A BUNCH OF CELLS AND WE BOTH HAVE SYSTEMS AND ORGANISMS INSIDE OF US
IT'S SHOWING THE ORGANISMS OF A HUMAN AND A BUTTERFLY THAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY HAS A STOMACH AND A HUMAN HAS A STOMACH A BUTTERFLY HAS INTESTINES AND A HUMAN HAS INTESTINES
THE HUMAN BECAUSE YEAST IS MADE UP OF ONE CELL THE HUMAN IS MADE UP OF TRILLIONS OF CELLS
THE PLANT LOOKS REALLY DIFFERENT COMPARED TO THE HUMAN BECAUSE THE LEAF IS LIKE GREEN AND HAS LIKE THESE BIG ROUND THINGS THAT ARE SORT OF LIKE CUPS AND THEY IT'S REALLY SIMILAR TO THEY LIKE HAVE A BUNCH THAT ARE SIMILAR WHEREAS WITH THE HUMAN THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL REALLY DIFFERENT LOOKING
SO WE LEARNED ABOUT CELLS AND HOW CELLS MAKE UP SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS YOU NEED SO YOU CAN DIGEST THINGS AND RUN AND MOVE AND DO ALL THAT THAT STUFF THAT YOU NEED TO DO
THEY'RE A LOT OF BIG SECTIONS THAT ARE CONNECTED WITH A BUNCH OF TINY THREADS OF TUBING SORT OF AND THERE'S LIKE A LOT OF IT
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE MOUTH YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO EAT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THE MOUTH YOU CAN CHEW THINGS UP AND MAKE IT WET WITH YOUR SALIVA SO THAT IT GOES DOWN THE THROAT
THE HUMAN CELLS THEY'RE ALL SCRUNCHED UP TOGETHER AND IN ONE BIG AREA AND IN THE LEAF THEY'RE ALL SCRUNCHED UP IN ONE BIG AREA IT SEEMS SO THEY BOTH SEEM KIND OF SIMILAR WITH THE WAY THAT THEY'RE THEY'VE BOTH GOT THE BIG SLIVERS ON THE TOP AND THE SMALL LITTLE CHOPPED UP PIECES OF PARTICLES IN THE MIDDLE OR NOT PARTICLES CELLS
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE ESOPHAGUS YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET FOOD INTO THE REST OF THE OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM SO NONE OF IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD OVERPOWER YOU AND YOU WOULD DIE
FLY IS MADE UP OF MANY CELLS AND ORGANISMS TOO
LOTS AND LOTS OF CELLS ALL OVER THE BODY AND SOME OF THE CELLS ARE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CELLS AND THE BODY IS MADE UP OF NINETY PERCENT CELLS AND TEN PERCENT YOU
THAT HUMANS ARE MADE UP OF MANY CELLS NOT JUST ONE BIG CELL
TO DIGEST THE FOOD SO THAT YOU CAN USE THE FOOD AS ENERGY
THEY BOTH HAVE ORGANS LIKE INTESTINES AND THE STOMACH AND THE THROAT AND SOME OF YOUR AND THE AND THEY BOTH HAVE SYSTEMS LIKE THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM AND THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
IT'S AN ENTIRE SYSTEM THAT WORKS TOGETHER WITH TINY LITTLE BITS SO THAT YOU CAN DIGEST THINGS AND MAKE IT COME OUT THE OTHER END PROPERLY
THEY'RE BOTH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CELLS IN ONE SYSTEM
THEY HAVE NEEDS THAT ARE VERY SIMILAR TO OUR LIKE WE NEED TO EAT SO THAT WE CAN GET ENERGY JUST LIKE BUTTERFLIES NEED TO EAT SO THAT THEY CAN FLY AROUND
YOU CAN USE THEM TO DRINK FOOD TO DRINK AND EAT MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AND IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE IT YOU'D DIE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T EAT ANYTHING OR GET ANY ENERGY
I THINK THAT IS YEAST OR SOME SORT OF ORGANISM MAYBE SOME SORT OF CELL
GETTING FOOD THROUGH ALL THE WAY THROUGH YOUR BODY IN THE FRONT IN THE TOP FRONT END AND OUT THE BOTTOM BACK END
THE PINK IS THE ENTIRE MUSCLE CELL
WE WERE LEARNING AND YEAST IS A LIVING CELL AND THAT IT'S A AND THAT THAT IS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT YEAST PARTICLES OR CELLS OR SYSTEMS
I'M DOING FINE
IT'S THE SAME PICTURE THAT WE LOOKED EARLIER WITH THE BIG THE BIG SLIVERS ON OF CELLS ON THE TOP AND THEN THE LITTLE CHOPPED UP BITS IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN THE DARKER BLUE CIRCULAR BITS ON THE BOTTOM
THEY BOTH ARE SIMILAR CAUSE THEY'VE EACH GOT CIRCLES IN THE MIDDLE EXCEPT THEY BOTH LOOK SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE YEAST IS MORE SEPARATED THAN THE HUMAN BECAUSE THE HUMAN'S GOT ALL THE PARTS ARE JUST KIND OF SCRUNCHED UP TOGETHER NEXT TO EACH OTHER WHEREAS THE YEAST THERE'S LIKE BIG GAPS BETWEEN THE YEAST
STOMACH IS FILLED WITH ACID SO THAT WHEN THE FOOD GETS INTO YOUR STOMACH IT CAN GRIND UP THE FOOD INTO A BUNCH OF TINY PARTS AND DIGEST IT BASICALLY SO THAT YOU COULD GET ENERGY THROUGH THE SMALL INTESTINE AND BIG INTESTINE
LOTS OF SKIN CELLS AND MUSCLE CELLS AND OTHER SYSTEMS LIKE BRAIN BRAIN THE BRAIN AND THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM AND THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
I THINK THAT THOSE CELLS ARE YEAST OR YEAST PARTICLES
I'VE BEEN STUDYING SYSTEMS AND MOLECULES AND LATELY WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON LIKE PUTTING WATER IN WITH YEAST AND A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS IN WITH YEAST
I'M NOT SURE CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
I SEE A HAMBURGER WHICH A PLANT DEFINITELY DOESN'T NEED ALTHOUGH I DO SEE SEEDS ON THE TOP OF THE BUN WHICH COULD BE SOMETHING THAT YOU'D USE TO GROW A PLANT LIKE THAT
WHAT IT SHOWS TOMATO JUICE I THINK AND IT'S DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING THAT THE PLANT WOULD NEED
SUNLIGHT AND WATER AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF FERTILIZER
IT'S SHOWING THAT THE PLANT NEEDS SUNLIGHT TO SURVIVE
I THINK THAT THE COOKIE IS IN THE BAG BECAUSE THE COOKIE HAS SUGAR IN IT AND WHEN YEAST AND SUGAR MIX TOGETHER THE THE YEAST STARTS TO BUBBLE AND SORT OF HAVE A LITTLE YEAST PARTY
MAYBE BECAUSE ONE HAS MORE WATER AND SUNLIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAVE QUITE AS MUCH AS THE OTHER ONE
THAT IS A HOUSE NEXT TO THE PLANT I THINK THAT THE PLANT WOULD NEED THAT SORT OF PLANT WOULD NEED SOMEONE TO TO TAKE CARE OF IT LIKE SOMEONE SPECIFICALLY TO WATER IT AND TO AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GETS SUNLIGHT
THEY ARE LIVING ORGANISMS THEY BASICALLY INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER ALMOST LIKE HUMANS BUT DIFFERENTLY THEY NEED THEY NEED TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER SO THAT THEY CAN DO THEIR JOB SORT OF LIKE A MAN AT WORK
THE PLANT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUNLIGHT SO THE PLANT IS DYING AND THE PLANT NEEDS SUNLIGHT JUST LIKE US NEED FOOD
I THINK IT'S SHOWING THAT THE PLANTS ALSO NEED AIR TO SURVIVE
DEFINITELY DEFINITELY DEFINITELY DEFINITELY
WELL THE PLANTS USE PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO GET THE IT FROM I'M GONNA START OVER
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE'D GET YEAST AND PUT IT PUT IT IN A BAG AND FILL IT THE BAG WITH WATER AND WE PUT AN ANIMAL CRACKER IN WITH IT
THAT PLANTS NEED WATER AND SUNLIGHT SO THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE JUST LIKE WE NEED FOOD AND WATER TO SURVIVE
CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
IT'S SHOWING HOW THE PLANT GETS ITS LIGHT AND IT'S CARBON DIOXIDE AND ITS OXYGEN AND ITS WATER AND ALL THE STUFF THAT IT REALLY NEEDS BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T HAVE ALL OF THAT STUFF IT WOULD DIE DIE
WITH PHOTOSYNTHESIS THE THEY USE THE SUNLIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD AND THEY ALSO USE WATER AS THEIR WHAT THEY USE TO DRINK BECAUSE EVERYTHING REALLY NEEDS WATER
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS AND MOLECULES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SORRY I'M ON THE WRONG WEBSITE
I THINK THIS IS A NON LEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE ALL REFLEXES ARE REALLY NOT LEARNED UNLESS THEY'RE SPECIAL REFLEXES
IT'S SHOWING UHM A PERSON'S REFLEXES LIKE WHEN A NERVE GETS TAPPED ON THEIR KNEE THEIR KNEE IT THEIR LEG WILL KICK
IT IS SHOWING THE ADAPTATIONS OF BOTH THE ANIMALS THE WOLF WHICH IS THE PREDATOR AND THE SKUNK WHICH IS THE PREY THE SKUNK LOOKS LIKE IT'S PUFFING UP ALMOST LIKE A CAT WITH ITS TAIL WHEN IT'S GETS SCARED AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GETTING IT'S TRYING TO MAKE ITSELF LOOK BIGGER SO THAT IT WILL SCARE AWAY THE WOLF WHERE AS THE WOLF LOOKS LIKE HE'S KIND OF WALKING AWAY BECAUSE THE BADGER LOOKS SCARY
THE FLOCK OF GEESE ALWAYS FOLLOWS ONE GOOSE BUT THEY TAKE TURNS WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THEIR MAIN BEHAVIOR
ITS TAIL PUFFING UP OR IT BLASTING A FART AT IT
IT LOOKS QUITE CAMOUFLAGED WITH ITS ORANGE STRIPES UHM SO THAT IT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE THE BACKGROUND JUST LIKE THE WHITE LIKE CORAL AND THE PINK LIKE STRANDS OF CORAL THAT LOOK ALMOST LIKE HIM
IS A NON LEARNED BEHAVIOR THAT IS AN INSTINCT THAT WHEN THE BABY TURTLES GET OUT OF THEIR EGG THEY SEE THE WATER AND THINK OH THAT LOOKS NICE AND IT LOOKS LIKE PROTECTION SO THEY GO STRAIGHT TO THE WATER
THAT THEY ALL HAVE SYSTEMS INSIDE OF THEM
THE PERSON IS GETTING BURNED SO THEIR HAND FLICKS BACK BECAUSE IT REALLY HURT SO THEY JUST WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THAT THING THAT REALLY HURT
NUMBER ONE ITS WINGS BECAUSE OF THEIR BRIGHT POWERFUL COLORS IT MAKES THE PREDATORS KIND OF CONFUSED ALMOST AND THAT IS A SIMILAR COLOR TO ANOTHER KIND OF BUTTERFLY THAT IS VERY POISONOUS SO THAT HELPS WARD OFF PREDATORS SO THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO GO NEAR IT
<DISCARD>
THOSE ARE ALL ANIMALS THAT HAVE CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS NERVOUS SYSTEMS UHM AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS ALL THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS JUST LIKE HUMANS
NUMBER TWO HIS TEETH SO HE CAN RIP OPEN HIS PREY
UHM I'M NOT SURE CAN YOU HELP ME ON THAT
UHM TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THE COLD WEATHER
HIS WEBBED FEET
THAT IS PART OF THE SKINS ADAPTATION IF THE SKUNK COULDN'T SMELL IT WOULD HAVE TROUBLE HUNTING OR SMELLING PREY OR BASICALLY SMELLING PREDATORS
THE CAT FELL OUT OF THE TREE AND SO I THINK THAT IS AN INSTINCT UHM SO IT'S NOT IT'S A NON LEARNED BEHAVIOR SO WHEN THEY FALL OUT OF THE TREE THEY FLIP OVER SO THAT THEY CAN LAND SOLIDLY AND WON'T GET HURT
THE SNAKE HAS AN ADAPTATION ON ITS TAIL THE RATTLE SO THAT IT WILL RATTLE ITS TAIL AND IT'LL MAKE A LOUD SHAKING SOUND AND WILL WARN PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE READY ATTACK AND WILL PROBABLY SCARE OFF OTHER PREDATORS AND THE HUMAN IS HAS ADAPTATIONS WHERE THEY'RE QUIVERING AND GETTING SCARED SO THEY HAVE THAT ADAPTATION SO THEY KNOW WHEN TO LEAVE
<DISCARD>
IT IS SHOWING ADAPTATIONS OF DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THE DOG WHEN IT SEES THE FRISBEE GO FLYING IT WILL GO RUN AND TRY AND GRAB IT THE FLOCK OF GEESE FOLLOWS ONE LEADER UHM AND THE STOVE IT LOOKS LIKE THE PERSON'S ABOUT TO TOUCH THE HOT STOVE AND BURN THEMSELVES SO WHAT THEY'LL PROBABLY DO IS PULL THEIR HAND BACK AND LIKE SCREAM OR LIKE GET REALLY UPSET AND LIKE BE MAD BECAUSE THEIR FINGER IS BURNED AND THE OTHER ADAPTATION IS THE PERSON'S KNEE GETTING TAPPED WITH A HAMMER WHICH WILL PROBABLY MAKE THEM KICK
I AM DOING WELL BUT YOU LOOK QUITE FAT MAN
BECAUSE THERE IS ANOTHER TYPE OF BUTTERFLY THAT IS REALLY REALLY POISONOUS AND SO WHEN A PREDATOR SEES ITS WINGS IT THINKS OF THAT OTHER BUTTERFLY AND LEAVES BECAUSE IT'S LIKE I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH THAT BUTTERFLY BECAUSE IT'S REALLY POISONOUS
THAT THEY ALL HAVE SYSTEMS LIKE CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS NERVOUS SYSTEMS SKELETAL SYSTEM AND MUSCULAR SYSTEM
THERE'S LIKE THE DOG UHM AND ANIMALS GO TOGETHER AND THEN THERE'S ALSO UHM LIKE PEOPLE WOULD GO TOGETHER WITH THE THINGS THAT THEY
WELL IT LOOKS HE'S GOT PRETTY BIG CLAWS ALSO SO HE CAN PROBABLY DIG REALLY WELL BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HE HAS QUITE OF A NOSE SO HE PROBABLY CAN'T SMELL ALL THAT WELL BUT IT DOES LOOK LIKE HE HAS ALMOST LIKE GILLS SO HE CAN PROBABLY SWIM PRETTY WELL AND HE'S GOT THAT HARD SHELL THAT HE CAN PROBABLY KIND OF CLIMB INSIDE LIKE A HERMIT CRAB AND BE PROTECTED LIKE THAT
NO I THINK THAT A DOG HAS TO BE TRAINED SO THAT IT KNOWS WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU THROW A FRISBEE FOR IT
THE TORTOISES SHELL IS HARD AND CAN PROBABLY PROTECT HIM VERY WELL
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S UHM SNIFFING FOR SOMETHING SO I'M GUESSING THAT IT'S GOT GOOD SENSES SO IT CAN FIND THINGS EASILY WITH ITS NOSE AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOT PRETTY BIG CLAWS SO IT CAN PROBABLY DIG PRETTY WELL SO THAT IT CAN USE THAT FOR PROTECTION PROBABLY
I THINK THAT IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE THOSE LETTERS AND HOW TO WRITE THOSE LETTERS AND HOW TO JUST WRITE
<SILENCE>
THE EARTH IS AND ENTIRE SYSTEM WITH MANY DIFFERENT SUBSYSTEMS LIKE DIFFERENT STATES AND COUNTRIES AND THERE ARE ALSO DIFFERENT OCEANS LIKE THE ATLANTIC AND THE PACIFIC AND FOR THE STATES THERE ARE THERE'S LIKE COLORADO AND NEW YORK AND OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES
THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED AS A DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIVING FORMS LIKE THE DECOMPOSERS AND THE ANIMALS
UM WELL THERE'S LIKE THE WATER WHICH SEEMS UM TO BE UM SMALL BUT IT'S REALLY A BIG PART OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IF WE DIDN'T HAVE WATER WE WOULDN'T HAVE TREES OR MUD AND I ALSO SEE ROCK AND LIFE FORMS LIKE TREES AND I SEE LIKE A HILL AND HOUSES WHICH PROBABLY HOUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE A BIG PART OF THE SYSTEM THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THEY'RE ONE OF THE SMARTEST LIFE FORMS ON THIS WHOLE SYSTEM AND SEEM TO BE IMPORTANT IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM
UM WELL THEY ALL ARE PART OF THE SAME SYSTEM THEY ALL UM ARE PART OF THE ENTIRE THEY'RE ALL SUBSYSTEMS OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM THEY UM HOLD TOGETHER EVERYTHING REALLY LIKE THEY ARE SOME OF THE TINY PARTS THAT YOU USE TO WALK ON LIKE THEY'RE PLACES FOR CERTAIN ANIMALS WHICH ARE ANOTHER SUBSYSTEM TO LIVE ON
I FORGET
ALL THE PARTS WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT BE ABLE TO MOVE AND DRIVE PEOPLE PLACES
BECAUSE IT HAS MANY DIFFERENT PARTS LIKE UM THAT ALL WORK TOGETHER AND TO LET YOU BE ABLE TO MOVE AND INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE
THEY ALL HAVE MANY DIFFERENT INTERACTING PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE WHOLE THING WORK
UM WELL THEY'RE ALL SYSTEMS LIKE THE HUMAN BODY SYSTEM ONE OF THEM IS THE HUMAN BODY SYSTEM ONE OF THEM IS THE EARTH WHICH IS A SYSTEM ONE OF THEM IS A SUITCASE WHICH IS EVEN A SYSTEM AND A TELEVISION AND A CAR THEY'RE ALL SYSTEMS
THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE BIOSPHERE THEY ARE ALL WHAT IS INSIDE OF THE BIOSPHERE MAKING IT AN ENTIRE SYSTEM REALLY
BIOSPHERE I THINK IS PROBABLY ALL OF THE LIKE LAND THAT STAYS TOGETHER AND HOLDS EVERYTHING TOGETHER UM LIKE WITH THE WATER AND THE SOIL AND THE LIFE FORMS LIKE TREES AND PEOPLE AND BIRDS
I THINK IT'S UM ONE OF THE WETLANDS SORT OF BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT DRYER IT'S GOT MORE LIFE FORMS THAN THE DRY LANDS DOES
THEY ALL CAN IT HOLD IT LIKE SITS ON THE EARTH TO MAKE THE WHOLE SYSTEM WORK LIKE OTHER SYSTEMS
THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
CAR IS A SYSTEM JUST LIKE THE HUMAN BODY AND THE EARTH IT HAS MANY DIFFERENT PARTS LIKE THE ENGINE WHICH HELPS IT IT WHICH REALLY IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE WOULDN'T LET THE ENTIRE THING WORK WHICH MEANS IT'S PART OF THE SYSTEM AND YOU NEED ALL THE PARTS FOR IT TO BE A SYSTEM
GOOD
THEY'RE ALL PART OF ONE WHOLE SYSTEM
WHAT SOME THINGS EAT LIKE A BIRD EATS A RABBIT AND UM LET'S SEE UH WHAT SOME THINGS ARE LIKE SIMILAR YOU KNOW LIKE UM
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE UM THE SYSTEMS A LOT OF SYSTEMS LIKE THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND STUFF LIKE HUMAN BODY CARS YOU KNOW
THE VEINS IN THE PLANT NEED TO BE TRANSPORTED IT NEED TO TRANSPORT THE WATER JUST LIKE THE VEINS IN THE LEAVES IN THAT ARE FROM THE BUSH NEED TO TRANSPORT WATER SO THAT THE LEAVES CAN GET WATER AND TO BECOME STRONGER LEAVES
I'M VERY GOOD BUT YOU JUST SCARED ME HALF TO DEATH BUT HOW ARE YOU
I THINK IT'S SHOWING HOW THE BUSH CAN TAKE IN LIGHT AND LET OUT OTHER LIGHT LIKE CARBON AND IT CAN ALSO TAKE IN AIR AND PUSH OUT AIR LIKE A CARBON DIOXIDE AND IT AND AIR
THEY ALL LOOK SIMILAR BUT VERY DIFFERENT THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM LEFT LOOKS SORT OF LIKE GRASS THE ONE ON THE TOP LOOKS KIND OF SPIKY AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS LOOKS MORE ROUND AND SMOOTH
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON STUDYING PLANTS LIKE WE'RE GROWING GRASS RIGHT NOW OR WHEAT WHEAT NOT GRASS
I'M GUESSING LIKE A MAPLE TREE LEAF IT LOOKS ALMOST LIKE A HAND BECAUSE THERE ARE FIVE DIFFERENT VEIN SEGMENTS JUST LIKE HUMANS HAVE FIVE FINGERS
SO THE ONE THAT IS A BLADE OF GRASS IS THE TWO SIDES ARE PARALLEL AND THE ONE THAT IS A SORT OF SPIKY LOOKS SORT OF LIKE A PALM AND THE ONE THAT'S SMOOTH LOOKS SORT OF ALMOST LIKE A FEATHER
A FEATHER LEAF I GUESS SORT OF LIKE FEATHERY MAYBE FROM A TREE THAT PRODUCES A LOT OF SAP BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S DARK AND HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE FOR CARE OF A LOT
THAT LOOKS LIKE A PLANT THAT IS BEING WATERED FROM THE TOP BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANY OXYGEN SO I DON'T THINK IT'LL LIVE VERY LONG
SO THAT THE TREE CAN GET IT'S SAP IN INTO THE LEAVES AND SO THAT IT CAN RUN THE WATER THROUGH THE LEAVE'S VEINS JUST LIKE A HUMAN'S VEIN RUNS THE HUMAN'S BLOOD THROUGHOUT IT'S BODY
THAT IT'S WIDE AND IS A LOT LIKE A HAND AND MAYBE THAT IT'S
THAT IT'S PROBABLY FAIRLY NEW COMPARED TO LIKE AN OLD LEAF IT WOULD BE KIND OF DRIED UP AND SHRIVELED SORT OF
IT'S THE BLOOD THAT MOVES ALL AROUND THE BODY SO THAT IT CAN GET TO THINGS AND TRY AND HEAL THEM MAKE FORM A SCAB WITH THE BLOOD IF THERE'S SOMETHING CUT THERE AND IT ALSO MOVES TO PLACES THAT ARE JUST INJURED IN ANY SHORT SORT OF SHAPE OR FORM
LUNG THE LUNGS DEFINITELY THE LUNGS
THROUGH A AND B THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
I THINK IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME HOW THEY CONNECT LIKE HOW THE ARTERIES CONNECT INTO THE HEART AND THE VEINS CONNECT INTO THE HEART
THE BLOOD VESSELS ARE WHAT ARE PUSHING THE BLOOD AROUND THE BODY LIKE THE BLOOD VESSEL IS SHOW IS PUSHING THE BLOOD INTO THE HEART AND THE VEIN VEINS ARE TAKING IT OUT TO OTHER PARTS
IT'S LETTING IN BLOOD AND THEN PUSHING OUT BLOOD
AIR COMES INTO THE BODY THROUGH THE MOUTH AND STRAIGHT DOWN THE TUBE THAT CONNECTS THE MOUTH NOSE AND THE NOSE AND THE THROAT TO THE LUNGS THE TRACHEA AND INTO THE BRONCHI AND BRONCHIOLES SO THAT WE AND WHICH PUSH IT INTO THE LUNGS WHICH CAN BE PUSHED AROUND BY THE DIAPHRAGM SO THAT WE CAN BREATHE AND DO ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE DO ON A DAILY BASIS
THE ALVEOLI
<DISCARD>
H TWO O AND O TWO
SYSTEMS PLANTS
F THE LUNGS
IS THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT IN SCIENCE
IT'S SHOWING HOW WE BREATHE HOW WE INHALE C O TWO AND EXHALE O TWO THROUGH THE LUNGS AND USING THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE LUNGS LIKE THE DIAPHRAGM AND THE BRONCHI AND THE ALL THE AND THE TRACHEA AND THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE SO THAT WE CAN GET ALL THAT DIFFERENT AIR THROUGH US
THE HEART PUMPS BLOOD AROUND THE BODY
SO THAT WE CAN BREATHE OUT O TWO SO THE TREES CAN BREATHE AND SO THAT WE CAN BREATHE C O TWO SO THAT TREE SO THAT TREES CAN GET RID OF THE C O TWO BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THAT IT WILL KILL THEM
THAT IS THE DIAGRAM THE SHEET OF MUSCLE THAT SITS UNDER THE LUNGS SO THAT WHEN THE DIAGRAM CONTRACTS THE LUNGS DRAW AIR IN SO THAT AND THE LUNGS GET ALL GET BIGGER AND THEN IT'S THE THE DIAPHRAGM RELAXES OR TOTALLY SETTLES DOWN AND THE LUNGS EXPEL AIR OR PUSH OUT THE AIR
THEY MOVE THE BLOOD AROUND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE BODY
THAT IS THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM OF A DOG AND A HUMAN WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON LOOKING AT SYSTEMS AND THAT HAPPENS TO BE THE MOST PREVIOUS ONE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT AND ACTUALLY THE HEART IS PART OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM WHICH WE DISSECTED A LITTLE WHILE AGO SO YEAH
IT'S SHOWING HOW THE ARTERIES AND VEINS CONNECT TO IT TO THE HEART AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS BASICALLY ARTERIES VEINS AND THE HEART
THAT THE BLUE PART IS CELL ARE CELLS AND THE RED PART IS CAPILLARY
<DISCARD>
<DISCARD>
THEIR SYSTEMS LOOK QUITE SIMILAR I MEAN THEY BOTH HAVE THE RED AND BLUE VEINS RUNNING THROUGH THEM AND ACTUALLY THEY'RE LIGHT RED AND DARK RED NOT RED AND BLUE
O TWO IS BEING PUSHED OUT ALONG WITH C O H TWO O AND C O TWO IS GOING INTO THE BLOOD CELLS AND BLOOD VESSELS
IT'S SHOWING ALL THE LITTLE DIFFERENT PARTS INSIDE OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
THE TRACHEA
THE RED PART THAT THE BLOOD CELLS ARE TRAVELING THROUGH ARE THE VEINS AND THE BLUE PART IS SKIN CELLS
THAT IS SHOWING HOW THE HEART PUSHES OUT THE BLOOD THROUGH THE BLOOD VESSELS AND THE BLOOD MOVES THROUGH THE BLOOD VESSELS AROUND THE BODY
EXCHANGING OUR GASES SO THAT WE CAN SURVIVE
GRAMS THE DIAPHRAGM LETS THEM INHALE AND EXHALE BY GETTING BIGGER AND TENSER AND THEN BY RELAXING SO THAT IT CAN BRING IN THE AIR AND PUSH OUT THE AIR
<DISCARD>
<DISCARD>
I THINK THAT IS A HEART
THE HEART IS WHAT CONTROLS IT ALL IT PUMPS THE BLOOD IN AND OUT OF THE OF THE IN AND OUT AROUND THE ENTIRE BODY AND IF WE DIDN'T HAVE IT WE WOULDN'T OUR BLOOD WOULD JUST GO EVERYWHERE AND WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SURVIVE BECAUSE THE BLOOD WOULDN'T BE GETTING TO ALL THE PARTS OF OUR BODY
I'M DOING FINE TALKED TO YOU EARLIER
BLOOD VESSELS THAT ARE PUSHING THE BLOOD AROUND
THE DIAGRAM
I THINK GRAMS THE DIAGRAM SO BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT OUR LUNGS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO EXPAND AND CONTRACT
IF WE DIDN'T BREATHE WE WOULD PASS OUT AND EVENTUALLY DIE
I THINK IT'S IN THE INSIDE OF A HUMAN'S BODY
THAT IS THE DIAPHRAGM THE SHEETS OF MUSCLE THAT SITS UNDER THE LUNGS WHEN THE DIAPHRAGM CONTRACTS THE LUNGS AIR THE LUNGS DRAW AIR IN LIKE THAT'S YOU BREATHING AND THEN THAT WHEN THE DIAPHRAGM RELAXES THE LUNGS EXPELL AIR OR GET RID OF IT PUSH IT OUT THROUGH THE MOUTH SO THAT YOU CAN EXCHANGE THE AIR WITH A TREE
INHALING AND EXHALING AIR IS EXCHANGING YOUR GAS SO YOUR GASES SO YOU CAN BREATHE LIKE YOU INHALE C O TWO AND YOU EXHALE O TWO
THE C O TWO AND O TWO ARE EXCHANGING THROUGH THE LUNGS THROUGH THE BLOOD CELLS FROM THE HEART AND THE BRINGING IT TO THE HEART
WELL I'VE BEEN WORKING ON GROWING GRASS AND WE'VE BEEN STUDYING THE GRASS AND STUFF AND THE GRASS IS STARTING TO GET PRETTY TALL SO YEAH THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
H
BECAUSE WE CAN'T BREATHE O TWO BUT TREES CAN WE WE BREATHE O TWO AND WE BREATHE OUT OR WE BREATHE IN C O TWO AND WE BREATHE OUT O TWO SO THAT AND THEN THE TREES BREATHE IN O TWO AND BREATHE OUT C O TWO SO THAT WE CAN BOTH BREATHE
THAT'S SHOWING THE DIAPHRAGM WORK WITH THE LUNGS AND THE TRACHEA AND ALSO THE NOSE AND THE MOUTH SO THAT IT CAN TAKE IN O TWO AND C O TWO SO THAT WE CAN BREATHE
A AND B THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
GO BYE LADY
THE AIR GOES IN THROUGH THIS LONG TUBE IN YOUR THROAT AND THEN THERE'S A LITTLE SPLIT CALLED THE THE BRONCHI AND THE BROCHIOLES AND THEY LET IN THEY THE TUBES THAT THEY ARE THE TUBES THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF THE BACTERIA AND GO UP INTO THE LUNGS
H THE ALVEOLI AND YEAH THE ALVEOLI H
BREATHING IS EXCHANGING GAS C O TWO AND O TWO
<DISCARD>
C
THAT IS SHOWING A HUMAN BREATHING BECAUSE IT SQUEEZES THE LUNGS IN SO THAT PUSHES OUT THE AIR AND THEN AND THEN OPENS THEM SO THAT THE AIR IS GOING IN SO THAT THEY CAN BREATHE AND SURVIVE
THOSE ARE THE TUBES THAT THE AIR GOES INTO SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE AIR INTO THE ALVEOLI ALVOIL I CAN'T I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PRONOUNCE IT A L V E O L I SO THAT THAT CAN PUT THE AIR INTO YOUR LUNGS SO YOU CAN BREATHE IN AND THEN IT SUCKS THE AIR BACK IN SO YOU CAN BREATHE OUT
I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
IT'S DEFINITELY THE LUNG
DOING GREAT HOW ARE YOU
I'M OBSERVING C O TWO COMING OUT OF THE BLOOD CELLS AND O TWO REPLACING IT AND THEN THE BLOOD IS GOING TO THE HEART PROBABLY I'M GUESSING
I THINK THAT'S SHOWING HOW THE AIR GETS INTO YOUR LUNGS IT'S SHOWING THE LITTLE THINGS THAT LET OUT THE AIR INTO YOUR LUNGS SO THAT YOU CAN BREATHE
GOOD HELLO MISS LADY HOW ARE YOU
THE DIAPHRAGM
A AND B THROUGH THE NOSE AND THE MOUTH SO THAT YOU CAN GET IT DOWN YOUR YOUR TRASHA TRACHEA AND YOUR BRONCHI AND SO THAT YOU CAN GET IT INTO THE LUNGS
E
WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING ON THIS SYSTEMS LIVING SYSTEMS INSIDE OF US AND THAT IS JUST ONE TINY SYSTEM THAT'S IN OUR LUNGS AND IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET C O TWO INTO OUR LUNGS AND WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BREATHE
IF YOU THE EXCHANGE OF GASES IS NEEDED BECAUSE WE BREATHE IN THE C O TWO AND TREES BREATHE IN JUST O TWO OR OXYGEN
RIGHT NOW WE ARE WORKING ON GROWING WHEAT IN A BLACK BAG AND A CLEAR BAG AND SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHICH ONE GROWS BETTER THE IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I'M GUESSING THE ONE IN THE CLEAR BAG IS GOING TO GROW BETTER BECAUSE IT'S GETTING LIGHT FROM THE SUN AND SO IT CAN USE PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHEREAS THE ONE IN THE BLACK BAG ISN'T SO IT'S NOT ABLE TO CREATE PHOTOSYNTHESIS
WHEN THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING IN IT <FP> IN A CIRCLE
YES IT DOES
UM A CIRCUIT IT IS IS COULD IS WHEN N YOU HAVE <BREATH> A BUNCH OF WIRES CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER WITH A SWITCH IF THE SWITCH IS OPE-
ENERGY <FP> ELECTRICITY IS IS FROM THE BATTERY TO BOTH ENDS AND THEN NE E <FP> COMES AND THEN IT GOES STRAIGHT INTO THE LIGHT BULB
A ON EACH SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO E WE PUT AND SO THERE'S ELECTRICITY FLYING TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND THEN ONE TOOK YOU CONNECT THE ELECTRICITY IN BETWEEN THE LIGHT BULB
THE ENERGY FROM IT YOU CAN MAKE THE MAKE A MOTOR OR A LIGHT RUN
YES
UM THE YE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY GOES GOES TO ONE LIGHT INTO BOTH LIGHTS <BREATH> AND THEN E THEY BOTH LIGHTS ARE CONNECTED SO E WE IF ONE END ST END ISN'T FLOWING THEN IT CAN STILL GET PE- ELECTRICITY
IT FLOWS FROM THE BATTERY UP THE WIRE AND AND GOES INTO AND THEN GOES INTO THE BULB
<BREATH> WHEN THE SWITCH IS IS OPEN THEN THE MOTOR CAN'T RUN CAUSE THE SWITCH IS CON IT CONNECTS THE WI- IS TOGETHER SO THE MOTOR CAN RUN <BREATH> AND AND IF THE SWITCH CLOSES THEN THE MOTOR CAN RUN CAUSE IT'S CONNECTING ALL THE WIRE
UM W IT IT BUZZED IS AND AND <FP> PART OF IT SPUN AROUND IN CIRCLES
UM WHEN YOU BY A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN OFF THE LIGHT AND WHEN YOU OPEN A CIRCUIT THEN IT CAN TURN ON THE LIGHT
IF THE Y BATTERY'S WIRES CONNECTED TO THE WRONG END OF THE BATTERY THE MOTOR CAN'T RUN AND THEN THE SWITCH HAS TO FACE THE CORRECT WAY FOR THE BATTERY <BREATH> FOR IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR W
THERE IS A SWITCH ON IT TO MAKE THE MOTOR TURN ON AND OFF
UM IT MAKES IT SO <FP> THAT THERE'S ENERGY FLOWING TOWARDS THE BULBS
UM UH WHEN WA <FP> TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND ONE WIRE'S CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULBS
A BATTERY IS UH CONNECTED TO WIRES TO MAKE TWO LIGHTS TURN ON
A BATTERY'S CONNECTED TO A MOTOR TO MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
EN IT WILL BE THEN WHAT IS TRYING TO TURN ON WILL BE OFF THEN IF YOU BY THE SWITCH IT IT WILL TURN ON <BREATH>
IN THEM
WE TOOK A SCALE AND PUT A STICK THAT HAD A MAGNET ON IT IN A HOLE THE SCALE HAD IT AND THEN A MAGNET ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THEY'D CONNECT THEN WE USED WA AND THEN WE USED WASHERS <BREATH> <FP> THEN WE PUT IN WASHERS TO SEE HOW MUCH HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK <BREATH> TO WE MAKE THE MAGNETS GO APART
THE MAGNET HAS TO BE ES STEEL WELL HAVE TO BE MAGNETIZING DOES ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PICK UP WITH WHAT YOU'RE MAGNETIZING ALSO HAS TO BE STEEL
YES
UH NO WE RUBBED A PAPER CLIP ON A MAGNET AND THEN TRIED TO CONNECT IT TO ANOTHER PAPER CLIP WITHOUT HOOKING IT TOGETHER
YES
YES
YES
<BREATH> THE MAGNETS MAGNETIZING THE NAIL SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
I FOUND OUT THAT MAGNETS <BREATH> IT'S SI SI IT'S HARDER TO <FP> IT WOULD GET THEM APART WHEN THEY'RE JUST TOGETHER WITH NOTHING IN BETWEEN THEM <BREATH> BUT IT'S EASIER <FP> TO GET THEM APART <FP> WHEN THERE'S A WHEN THERE'S IS A LITTLE CHIP
<FP> THAT IT THAT <BREATH> YOU HAVE THAT YOU HAVE TO O CONNECT A CERTAIN SIDE OF THE MAGNET TOGETHER TO GET IT TO MAGNETIZE
WE'VE S WE'VE TESTED HOW LONG YOU CAN <BREATH> IT HOW MUCH IT WEIGHT IT TAKES TO <BREATH> AWAY IT WOULD BREAK THE <FP> <FP> MAGNETIC POLE IN BETWEEN TWO MAGNETS
UM <BREATH> NEH- IN THAT IT YOU CAN MAGNETIZE E SOME THINGS BY RUBBING <BREATH> ING THEM ON A MAGNET
YOU NEED A CERTAIN SI A T YOU NEED TO RUB A CERTAIN SIDE TO THE MAGNET AND THEN RUB AND THEN TOUCH THAT SIDE TO A CERTAIN ANY SIDE OF THE OBJECT TO YOU'RE TRYING TO MAGNETIZE
WITH REGULAR MAGNET YOU CAN'T DROP THINGS IF YOU WANT TO DROP IT YOU HAVE TO PULL IT OFF
YES
GOOD
UM <BREATH> A SWITCH TURNS THE MAGNET ON AND OFF CAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE COMPLETING A CIRCUIT <BREATH>
THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE SWITCH AND AROUND THE NAIL MAKING IN AND FIELD AROUND AND IT IT'S A OOH IT'S AN ELECTROMAGNET
UM IF YOU NEED TO MOVE SOMETHING HEAVY AND METAL MOVED TO A DIFFERENT PLACE
NO
<BREATH> IF YOU CAN START PICKING UP THE WASHERS WITH IT THEN YOU CAN TELL IT'S MAGNETIC
YES
YES
IF IT ISN'T <BREATH> ABLE TO PICK UP ANY WASHERS WITH IN THE SWITCH IT'S OPEN
UM THE TEACHER DID AN EXAMPLE <BREATH> WITH THE PROJECTOR
WE CONNECTED A BATTERY TO A SWITCH THEN WE CONNECTED THE BATTERY SWITCH TO A BIG METAL NAIL OH BY WRAPPING A WIRE AROUND IT THEN WE PICKED UP WASHERS
UM IT WAS KIND OF LIKE MAKING A CIRCUIT
UM <BREATH> HE CONNECT HE FIRST CONNECTED THE ER <BREATH> BATTERY AND SWITCH AND THEN WRAPPED IT AROUND AND THEN THEY THEY WRAPPED THE WIRE AROUND THE NAIL AND HAD ONE OF US COME UP TO FLIP THE SWITCH AND SEE HOW MANY WASHERS THEY COULD PICK UP
WHEN THIS IF THE SWITCH ISN'T CLOSED THEN IT CAN'T MAKE THE NAIL INTO A MAGNET CAUSE IT ALL HAS TO BE CONNECTED FOR IT FOR THE NAIL TO BE A MAGNET
<BREATH> WELL ME AND MY PARTNER PREDICTED THAT UM IF THAT W WE WOULD CHANGE ONE VARIABLE THAT IS WE MOVE THE FLIPPER BASE AND EVERYTHING UP HIGHER AND WE SAID THAT WE PREDICT IT WILL UM GO FARTHER BECAUSE THE IT'LL BE HIGHER UP AND IT'LL PROBABLY GO FARTHER BECAUSE IT'LL PROBABLY GO STRAIGHTER UP AND THEN GO FARTHER AND THEN GO DOWN
WELL UM THE RUBBER BAND UM TAKES WINDS AND WHEN YOU WIND IT UP IT TWISTS THE RUBBER BAND SO WHEN YOU LET GO IT MAKES IT IT ACTUALLY MAKES THE PROPELLER GO FASTER SO IT GIVES IT UP SPEED
WELL THE POPSICLE STICK HELPS UM IT HOLDS UP THE PROPELLER AND THE UM STRAWS HOLD UP THE WHOLE PLANE AND THOSE KIND OF FORM THE BODY OF THE PLANE AND THE PROPELLER UM HELPS MOVE THE PLANE
YEAH WE'LL PROBABLY TRY OUT AND LAUNCH THOSE TOMMOROW-
UM PROBABLY THE FLIPPER BASE AND THE UM STICK THAT HOLDS IT UP AND THE RUBBER STOP
YEP
WELL THE RUBBER BAND THE PROPELLER MADE THE UM WHOLE PLANE ACTUALLY MOVE AND THE STRAW AND THE UM THE STICKS ACTUALLY HELD UP THE PLANE SO IT COULD FLY AND THE STRINGS <BREATH> THE STRING ACTUALLY HELD UP THE WHOLE PLANE
WELL UM THE TWO THE THREE STRAWS ONE ON THE TOP THAT HOLDS UM THE HOLDS THE WHOLE PLANE UP AND THEN THE STICK AND THE STRAWS ARE THE BODY OF THE PLANE AND THE PROPELLER AND THE RUBBER BAND A ARE THE ONES THAT MAKE THE SPEED AND MAKE IT MOVE
YEAH THE RUBBER BAND
YEP
HI
WELL THE UM THE STRAWS HOLD UP AND THE STICK HOLDS THE RUBBER BAND AND THE PROPELLER AND THE STRAWS HOLD UP THE WHOLE PLANE
WELL WE WERE GONNA UM PUT IT HIGHER ON LIKE A STACK OF BOOKS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN WE'RE GONNA SEE IF IT WILL GO FARTHER FIRST WE'RE GONNA DO IT ON THE FLOOR OR SOMETHING FLAT AND THEN WE'RE GONNA SEE ON THE BOOKS TO SEE IF IT WOULD GO FARTHER OR IF IT WOULD GO LIKE NOT AS FAR
CAN I SEE A PICTURE OF
CAN YOU SHOW ME A PICTURE OF THE FLIPPER
<BREATH> YEP THE WEIGHT MAY UM AFFECT HOW FAR IT GOES
UM ALL WE DID SO FAR IS WE DID THE PREDICTIONS AND THE QUESTIONS AND SHE HASN'T DESCRIBED ALL THE PARTS SO WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE
WE'LL PROBABLY MAKE EITHER A GRAPH OR WE'LL PROBABLY MAKE A CHART
A I'M NOT SURE SINCE WE HAVEN'T LEARNED MUCH ABOUT THIS
<BREATH> WELL WE COULD INSTEAD OF A CORK WE COULD LIKE USE A BALL OF TIN FOIL LIKE MISTER SUGGESTED OR WE COULD USE SOMETHING HEAVIER AND THAT MIGHT AFFECT HOW FAR IT GOES
HOLD ON
WELL WE UM SPINNED THE PROPELLER LIKE TWENTY FIVE TIMES AND WE ADDED TWO PAPER CLIPS EACH TIME TO SEE HOW FAR IT WENT WITH MORE PAPER CLIPS
<BREATH> WE'VE BEEN MAKING PREDICTIONS AND QUESTIONS ON THE FLIPPER AND THE LAUNCHER OF THE FLIPPER
THAT THEY ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT PURPOSE THE CORK IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA LAUNCH AND THEN THE RUBBER STOPPER HELPS IT UM STAY UP AND THEN
WELL THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT WE DID <BREATH> SO FAR AND WE'RE GOING TO START UM MAKING THIS ACTUALLY MAKING IT TOMORROW
WELL WE'RE GONNA PUT A CORK AND THEN WE'RE GONNA LAUNCH IT AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS AND SEE HOW FAR IT'LL GO
STICK IS UM HOLDING IT UP AND THE FLIPPER BASE IS HOW WE HOLD IT UP AND LAUNCH IT
BYE
YES BECAUSE UH <BREATH>
WELL FIRST WE TRIED THE PUTTING IT UM WHERE THE STICK WAS INSTEAD OF WHERE THE STRAW WAS BUT WE KIND OF COULD TELL IT KIND OF INTERFERED HOW IT WENT KIND OF THE PAPER CLIP KIND OF SWUNG HIT THE STRING SO WE ASKED OUR TEACHER AND THEN WE S NOTICED THAT IT WAS WRONG
OR YOU CAN FIGURE OUT IF THAT THING MADE IT WORSE OR
YES
UM WOW <LAUGH> WE UM IT WAS INTERESTING HOW MUCH THE PAPER CLIPS AFFECTED THE PLANE
HELLO
IT'LL MAKE THE PLANE GO SLOWER AND IT WON'T GO AS FAR
WELL IT WOULDN'T BE EXACTLY
WHEN THE UM WHEN THE WELL WINDS IS LIKE HOW FAST IT GOES AND NUMBER OF PASSENGERS IT'S UM THE MORE PASSENGERS YOU HAVE THE THE SHORTER THE DISTANCE IS SO IF YOU HAVE LIKE TEN PASSENGERS IT MIGHT NOT GO AS FAR AS IT WILL WITH ONE PASSENGER
WELL THE MORE THE LESS PASSENGERS YOU HAVE THE LONGER THE DISTANCE WILL BE AND THE MORE PASSENGERS YOU HAVE IT WON'T GO AS FAR
WE'VE
BYE
WELL WE ADDED TWO EVERY TIME SO TWO FOUR SIX EIGHT SO WE COULD SEE HOW MUCH IT THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE BETWEEN HOW MUCH WE PUT ON
RIGHT
WELL ONE TIME WE THE PAPER CLIPS IT TIPPED OVER THE PLANE AND IT KIND A THE STRING BROKE BECAUSE THERE WAS TOO MANY PAPER CLIPS ON SO WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT WAS BREAKING AND WE KIND OF REALIZED IT WAS ON THE WRONG PLACE AND THAT AFFECTS IT
WE HAVE BEEN WE'VE BEEN PUTTING TWO PASSENGERS AT A TIME AND THEN SEEING HOW FAR IT WILL GO WITH TWENTY FIVE WINDS AND THEN WE ADD TWO MORE AND THEN SEE HOW FAR THAT WILL GO AND WE KEEP ADDING UNTIL WE GET TO TEN
WELL IF WE DID MORE WINDS IT MIGHT MAKE IT GO A LITTLE FARTHER BUT NOT THAT FAR BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE OF THE PAPER CLIPS
WELL WE FIGURED OUT THE MORE PAPER CLIPS IT HAS THE S THE THE SLOWER IT GOES AND IT DOESN'T GO AS LONG
WELL IF LIKE YOU TAKE OFF ONE OF THE OF THE STRAWS IT MIGHT AFFECT THE PLANE <BREATH>
WE ADDED T WELL YOU ADDED TOO MANY PAPER CLIPS AT A TIME THEN YOU TOOK T TOO MANY OUT OF IT UH TOO MANY OFF
WELL WITH THE TWO BLUE STRAWS HOLD UP THE PAP THE PA THE UM POPSICLE STICKS SO THAT UM WE HOLD THE PROPELLER IN THE TWO ENDINGS AND WE PUT THE RUBBER BAND ON SO WE TWIST THE RUBBER BAND AND IT MAKES THE PROPELLER WIND
HELLO
GOOD
IT BETTER AND YOU COULD ONLY CHANGE YOU'D ONLY CHANGE ONE AT A TIME BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE TOO MANY YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF THAT ONE OF 'EM OUT OF THAT WOULD MAKE IT BETTER AND THE OTHER ONE JUST MADE IT WORSE
WELL I THINK THAT UM IF YOU HAD THREE PASSENGERS IT WELL ACTUALLY ONE PASSENGER WOULD GO A LITTLE FARTHER SINCE IT WASN'T THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT MUCH IMPACT OF HOW THE WEIGHT IS OF THE UM OF THE PLANE
WELL IT DEPENDS IF YOU ADD TOO MANY PASSENGERS IT'LL IT'LL MAKE THE
WELL WE WE ADDED TWO PAPER CLIPS EACH TIME THAT AFFECTED HOW THE DISTANCE HOW FAR IT WAS
HELLO HI
HOW FAR IT WILL GO
WELL THE
HELLO
GOOD
WELL WE CHANGED IT TO SEE IF WE GOT IT RIGHT THAT TIME OR IF IT MADE THAT WORSE OR MAKE IT BETTER
WELL WE DON'T UM TEST THE STICKS AND WE DON'T UM TEST THE UM THE THE STRING EXACTLY BECAUSE THE POPSICLE STICK'S JUST KIND OF IT'S LIKE THE BODY OF IT AND THE STRING JUST HELPS HOLD IT UP
WELL X IS NUMBER OF MOTORS OR RUBBERBANDS AND Y IS THE DISTANCE
WELL IT'S UM OTHER SIDE SO IT'LL BE EASIER TO LIST
WELL THAT SO WE COULD TELL WHICH THE DIFFERENCE IS AND IT'LL BE EASIER TO EXPLAIN
UH UM THEY'RE AND UH UM X AND THE Y ARE MATCHED UP SO THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
HELLO OH MY
THE NUMBER OF THE NUMBERS THAT IT GOES UP TO THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS AND THE DISTANCE AND HOW FAR THAT GOES UP TO
WELL IF YOU LIKE ADD TWO PAPERCLIPS AND IT MAKES IT GO LESS THAN UM IT WILL LIKE HAVE LIKE FROM LIKE IT'S WELL UM I'M NOT SURE
IT'LL GO PRETTY FAR
WELL THE MORE YOU ADD THE UM THE MORE RUBBERBANDS YOU ADD ARE MOTORS THAT GOES FARTHER SO IF YOU ADD TEN
WE WERE DOING GRAPHING AND THE WE DID UM THAT THE MORE PAPERCLIPS WE HAVE UM THE LESS THE LESS FARTHER IT GOES
WELL UM USUALLY IT DOESN'T MATTER BUT YOU HAVE TO LIKE LIST LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS AND THE DISTANCE AND IT DOESN'T EXACTLY MATTER WHAT SIDE YOU PUT IT ON THOUGH
WELL WE UM LISTED THE NUMBERS OF PASSENGERS AND THE DISTANCE AND WE REALIZED THAT THE MORE PASSENGERS YOU HAVE THE UM IT DOESN'T GO AS FAR
SO YOU CAN UM
OKAY BYE
OKAY
WELL YOU CAN
THAT UM THE MORE YOU HAVE THE HIGHER THE NUMBER GETS IN THE Y AND THE X GETS HIGHER TOO BUT THE UM THE Y GETS PRETTY HIGH SO THAT MEANS THAT LIKE YOU'RE ADDING A LOT OF THIS AT A TIME
WELL WE UM IF LIKE WE ADDED AN EXTRA PAPERCLIP AND THEN UM AND IT SLOWED DOWN EVEN MORE AND UH THE PEOPLE ARE IN EXCESS ADDED LIKE A BUNCH OF RUBBERBANDS AND IT DID A FLIP BUT IT DIDN'T GO AS FAR
WE'VE BEEN MAKING PA WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLANES AND TESTING UM THEM AND SEEING WE'VE BEEN CHANGING SOME VARIABLES AND SEEING WHAT IT WOULD DO
WELL IT'S GOES UP BECAUSE THE MORE YOU UM THE MORE YOU MOTORS YOU HAVE OR PENNIES YOU HAVE IT'LL BE LIKE UM IT GOES FARTHER UP
WELL WE COULD CHANGE LIKE HOW MANY RUBBERBANDS WE HAD OR PUT ON SOME EXTRA PASSENGERS OR ME AND MY PARTNER MADE WINGS
WELL THE MORE YOU ADD THE PASSENGERS THE DISTANCE WILL IT IT WON'T GO AS FAR
WELL YOU PLACE THE Y THERE BECAUSE IT'S ON THE LINE OF THE AND THEN IT'LL BE IT'LL BE LIKE RIGHT THERE SO YOU IT'S EASIER
WE WERE IN CHARGE OF SEEING HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES WE CAN HOLD AND WE DID FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS SO WE COULD SEE WHAT THE DIFFERENCE WAS
THE HIGHER IT GETS THE MORE PASSENGERS IT GETS AND MORE CAPACITY IT CAN GET
GOOD
WELL THE S SMALLER THE BOAT IS THE LESS PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD
WELL WE KNEW THAT THERE IS ONE A FEW THAT HAD WAX ON THE OUTSIDE AND THAT THOSE MAY BE ABLE TO HOLD MORE WATER BECAUSE THEIR MIGHT BE STRONGER THAN THE PAPER CUPS AND THAT THE CAPACITY WOULD BE LIKE IF WAIT
THAT AS THE CAPACITY GETS HIGHER SO DOES THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
WELL FIRST WELL WE PUT THE HOW MUCH CAPACITY THE BOATS COULD HOLD AND THEN HOW MUCH PASSENGERS IT CAN HO IT CAN HOLD AND IF YOU PUT THE PASSENGERS IN THE MIDDLE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HOLD MORE BUT IF THEY'RE ON THE SIDE THEN YOU COULD PRO IF THEY'RE ALL S ON THE SIDE IT'LL PROBABLY TIP OVER SOONER
KAY YEAH
WELL THE YOU CAN YOU CAN FIND THAT MAYBE ONE IT LIKE ONE BOAT CAN HOLD MORE PASSENGERS TH AND ONE CAN HOLD LESS BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE
<BREATH> ALRIGHT SO LET'S SEE
IT'S HOW CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD
UH HOW MUCH HOW THEY PUT THE PENNIES IN THEY STACKED THEM IN THE IN THE MIDDLE INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM ALL TO ONE SIDE OR JUST PUTTING THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THEY THEY SET THEM IN INSTEAD OF DROPPING THEM
WELL WE PUT DOWN HOW MUCH CAPACITY UNTIL WE GET TO THE HIGHEST NUMBER AND HOW MUCH THE PASSENGERS UNTIL WE GOT
WELL WE DID FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE COULD TELL WHICH ONE COULD HOLD MORE AND WHICH ONE COULD HOLD LESS
WHAT WE DID HERE IS WE WE FOUND ONE
WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER BOATS AND SEEING THE CAPACITY AND HOW MUCH PASSENGERS THEY CAN HOLD AND WE'VE BEEN DOING GRAPHS
WE DID FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS SO WE COULD TELL WHICH SO IF WE DID ALL FOUR THE SAME WE WOULDN'T KNOW IF DIFFERENT SIZES COULD HOLD MORE OR LESS
WELL WE
THAT THE MORE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD THE MORE PASSENGERS <BREATH>
WELL IT DEPENDS OF THE SIZE OF THE BOAT HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH YOU CAN IT COULD HOLD
UM IF YOU CHANGE ONE VARIABLE THEN THE OTHER IF IT WORKS BETTER OR LESS THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THE OTHER VARIABLE SO YOU ONLY CH- SO CHANGE ONE AT A TIME
WE
IT SHOWS YOU WHAT WHERE THE WHERE THE THE CAPACITY AND THE PASSENGERS MEET UP ON THE GRAPH
WELL HOW HOW BIG THE BOAT IS AND HOW TALL IT IS AFFECTS HOW MUCH PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD
WELL ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS HOW MUCH THE NUMBER OF PASSENGER NO YEAH IS THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS THAT IT CAN
IT CAN HOLD TOO AND THAT IF THE CAPACITY IS WH- TH WHEN THE CAPACITY IS KINDA LOWER WHEN THE CAPACITY IS LOWER THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS IS LOWER ALWAYS LOWER THAN THE HOW MUCH THE CAPACITY CAN HOLD
WELL ON THE BOTTOM IS UH HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD AND THE PASSENGERS AND THEN
WELL YOU WOULD TAKE YOU WOULD LESSEN EITHER BY TENS OR BY TWOS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU WOULD CONNECT THEM LIKE HOW MANY PASSENGERS IT COULD HOLD YOU COULD LIKE GO TWO FOUR SIX EIGHT AND TEN ON EACH WAY AND THEN YOU CONNECT THEM AND IT SHOULD HAVE GONE UP THE GRAPH INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN
THE DIFFERENT SIZE OF THE CUP DEPENDS HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD
IF YOU CHANGE TOO MANY AT ONE TIME THEN YOU WON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT IT RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OR THAT YOU HAD TOO MANY CHANGE OR YOU HAD JUST RIGHT AMOUNT OF CHANGE
WELL THEY'RE PUTTING 'EM IN THE MIDDLE SO IT CAN HOLD MORE BUT IF YOU PUT 'EM ALL TO THE SIDE IT'LL TIP OVER UM WITH LESS AMOUNT IN PENNIES THAN IT ACTUALLY CAN HOLD
YOU WELL THAT THE MORE IF YOU LOOK AT THE PATTERN THE MORE THE CAPACITY IS THE PASSENGERS ALWAYS LESS THE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD
LIKE YOU COULD HAVE IF YOU ADDED TOO MANY THINGS YOU
WELL YOU SHOULD UM
KNOW IF THEY'RE WRONG OR RIGHT
IF YOU DON'T USE ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS THEN IT COULD UM LET'S SAY YOU DO ONE THAT'S EIGHT CENTI-
IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE MIDDLE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE SINCE IT'S BALANCED AND IF YOU PUT THEM KINDA EVERYWHERE IT'LL SINK FASTER
CAUSE IT DEPENDS HOW YOU PUT THE PENNIES IN IF YOU KIND OF DROP 'EM IN THEY MIGHT BE LESS IF YOU SET 'EM IN IT MIGHT BE EASIER IF YOU PUT 'EM ON ONE SIDE IT MIGHT BE HARDER TO DO THAT AND IF YOU STACK 'EM EVENLY IT MIGHT HAVE MORE
WHEN THE BOAT
HOW MUCH HOW TALL THE BOAT WAS AND HOW WIDE IT WAS
THIS WEEK IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE CAPACITY OF BOATS WITH LITTLE PAPER CUPS AND WE'VE BEEN SEEING HOW MUCH WATER THEY CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES THEY CAN HOLD
UM IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S DIFFERENT SIZES AND IF THEY WEREN'T DIFFERENT SIZES THEY WOULD JUST CARRY THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER AND PENNIES
WELL THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT BE UM MIGHT NOT AS M
THE ONE THAT'S UNDER WATER HAS TOO MANY PENNIES BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL PILED UP AND THEY'RE SPREAD OUT BUT THE ONE UM THAT'S STILL ABOVE IS EVEN AND IT'LL BE EASIER
UM THERE WE DESIGNED THEM TO HOLD PENNIES AND TO HOLD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WATER AND TO SEE HOW UM MUCH WATER THEY COULD HOLD
<BREATH> WELL IF UM IF YOU DON'T GET IT THE SAME MEASUREMENT THEN SOMEONE IF YOU'RE LIKE DOING A PENDULUM LIKE LAST YEAR WELL LAST WEEK UM IF YOU DO A SHORTER LENGTH OR A LONGER LENGTH YOU MIGHT END UP WITH A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF SWINGS
IF YOU SET THEM DOWN IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO PUT MORE IN IF YOU KIND A JUST DROP 'EM IN IT MIGHT YOU KNOW MAKE IT SINK
UM LET'S SEE IF W
IF YOU LIKE PUT THEM ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK OVER IF YOU BALANCE 'EM IT MIGHT HA BE ABLE TO HOLD MORE
IF YOU ONLY CHANGE IF YOU CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME IT WILL BE EASIER TO SEE IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT OR WRONG
TO SEE WHICH ONE WOULD WORK BETTER IF THE SMALLER ONE OR THE MEDIUM SIZED ONE OR THE BIGGER ONE AND SO WE COULD JUST CHOOSE DIFFERENT KINDS AND SEE WHAT THE RESULTS ARE FOR DIFFERENT ONES
YOU'RE ONLY STACKING ON ONE SIDE AND IF YOU STACK 'EM ON ONE SIDE IT'S GONNA SINK IF YOU STACK 'EM IN THE MIDDLE LIKE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IT'LL STAY UP LONGER
IF YOU WOULD LET'S SEE UM
UM THE SMALLER ONES MIGHT NOT AS HOLD AS MUCH PENNIES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AS TALLER AND IT'LL OVERFLOW FASTER
PAPER CUPS
IF YOU CHANGE TOO MANY
IF YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO SEE IF THAT THING MADE IT WORSE OR BETTER
AT ONE TIME YOU COULD
IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEN IT'LL BE HARDER TO PUT MORE PENNIES IN AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER IT'LL BE EASIER SINCE THEY'RE TALLER AND YOU CAN PUT MORE PENNIES IN WITHOUT IT SINKING
ONCE THE BOAT SUNK YOU TOOK ONE PENNY OUT AND THEN COUNTED HOW MANY PENNIES YOU HAVE LEFT AND SEE THAT'S HOW MANY PASSENGERS YOUR BOAT CAN HOLD
IF LET'S SEE UM WE'RE
WITH STRING AND THEN THE OTHER ONE'S SUPPOSED TO BE EIGHT TOO BUT IF YOU DO ONE THAT'S ACCIDENTALLY NINE IT'LL END UP BEING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
IF THE BOAT IS SMALLER IT'LL BE HARDER TO PUT THE PENNIES IN SINCE IF IT HAD MORE PRESSURE AND WEIGHT ON IT AND IT'S NOT AS TALL AND IT'LL SINK WITH MORE LESS PENNIES
IF THE WATER IS LIKE HA IT'S REALLY TALL WAVES IT'LL KNOCK 'EM OVER BUT IF IT'S CALM AND KIND OF FLAT AND JUST SITTING THERE THEN IT'LL BE EASIER TO STACK THEM
OKAY I'M NOT SURE ON THIS ONE
<BREATH> THEY'RE ABOUT WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO SEE UM W HOW MANY PENNIES CAN FIT INTO IT WITHOUT IT SINKING AND UM
CAUSE IF THEY WERE THE SAME THEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF YOU KNOW OTHER KINDS WOULD WORK BETTER OR WORK LESS
THAT THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT HOLD LESS AMOUNT OF PENNIES AND THEN THE MEDIUM WILL HOLD A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE
WE UM WE MADE FOUR BOATS OUT OF PAPER CUPS AND WE HAD TO MAKE IT BETWEEN ONE CENTIMETER AND FOUR CENTIMETERS
THAT IF YOU STACK 'EM IT WILL STAY EVENLY AND THAT IT COULD HOLD MORE AND IF YOU JUST KIND OF PUT THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK THAT WELL WITHOUT SINKING
YOU SHOULD STOP THERE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ANY MORE IN YOU'LL PROBABLY OVERFLOW THE BOAT
I CAN'T I'M NOT SURE
THAT THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY'RE WIDER OR TALLER THEY'LL WILL HOLD MORE WATER AND MORE PENNIES
U
THE STRAWS TRIED TO H TO HOLD UP THE STRING AND THE POPSICLE STICKS WE NARROWED IT DOWN SO IT WOULD FIT IN TO THOSE LITTLE THINGS THAT HOLD THE RUBBER BAND AND THEIR PROPELLER AND THAT'S HOW IT WORKS
WELL YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW FAR YOU SHOULD SPREAD APART YOUR STRAWS AND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOU SHOULD USE AND HOW MANY TIMES YOU UH WIND UP THE PROPELLER
WELL FLIGHT LINE HOLD
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE BODY THE PROPELLER AND WHAT THE STRING AND WHAT'S HOLDING IT UP
BYE THANK YOU
BODY OF IT AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT HOLDS IT UP AND MAKES IT FLY
THEY THEY HELD UP THE UM PROPELLER AND IT HELPED TO SPIN IT AND IT KEPT IT FROM FALLING DOWN AND IT HELPED A LOT
WELL I THINK YOU MAYBE THAT IT MIGHT BE MORE HELPFUL IF YOU CHANGE THE HOW MANY TIMES YOU WIND UP THE PROPELLER AND WHAT KIND OF STRAWS YOU USE AND WHAT KIND OF STRING AND IF THE STRING'S AT AN ANGLE
EFFECTS HOW MUCH IT CAN FLY
WE USED DIFFERENT WE USED DIFFERENT MATERIALS AND WE USED CRAFT STICKS AND WE HAD TO NARROW IT DOWN WITH SANDPAPER AND WE CUT THE STRAWS IN HALF AND PUNCHED HOLES THROUGH 'EM AND THEN WE STICK THE OTHER STRAW THROUGH 'EM AND PUT IT ON THE STRING AND THEN TWISTED THE PROPELLER AND SEE HOW FAR IT COULD GET
WELL IF IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME LEVEL AND IT'S TIGHT AND IT'S NOT LOOSE THEN IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO FLY EASIER AND MORE SMOOTH BUT IF IT'S LOOSE AND IT'S KIND A HAS A DIP THEN IT MIGHT BE HARDER FOR IT TO GET UP
GOOD
PELLER UP SO WE COULD SE
WELL
IS THAT YOU YOU HAVE THE PROPELLER AND SOMETHING THAT HOLDS THE PROPELLER UP AND THEN YOU HAVE
AND MAKING PLANES WITH STRAWS ON A PROPELLER AND WE TOOK THE STRING AND TIED IT TO TWO CHAIRS AND WIND UP THE PROPELLER AND SEE HOW FAR IT COULD GET
WE USED POPSICLE STICKS AND A PROPELLER AND STRAWS AND THEN WERE WE WERE SPINNING THE PROPELLER TWENTY FIVE TIMES TO SEE IT HOW FAR IT COULD GET DOWN THE STRING
WELL THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM'S NOT AS STRAIGHT AS THE ONE ON TOP UP AND I THINK THAT IF THE ONE ON THE TOP'S STRAIGHTER IT'LL BE EASIER FOR IT TO FLY BUT AT THE ONE AT AN ANGLE IT MIGHT BE HARDER FOR
WELL ME AND MY PARTNER WE PUT OUR STRING AT AN ANGLE AND WE LEARNED THAT IF YOU PUT IT AT AN ANGLE IT
HELLO
WHAT MAKES A PROPELLER SO
UM WE COULD SEE HOW IT COULD WHEN WE SPIN IT HOW FAR IT COULD GO
THE UM THE CAP
CAPACITY IS UH HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD AND IF
THE SMALLER ONES DON'T HOLD AS MUCH WATER AND PENNIES BUT THE TALLER ONES AND THE BIGGER ONES HOLD MORE
HOW WIDE AND HOW TALL THE BOAT IS
IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEY WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER THEY'LL HOLD MORE
YOU'RE WELCOME
GOOD
WE PUT THE WA
IF THE WATER'S TOO ROUGH THE BOAT COULD TIP OVER BUT IF IT'S CALM IT'LL BE EASIER TO PUT THE PENNIES AND IT'LL STAY UP
WE'RE GONNA S WE S SEE HOW MANY CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PENNIES THEY COULD HOLD
SIZE IS COM UH MATTER WHAT HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD THE SIZE IS YOU KNOW KIND A DETERMINE WHAT HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD
THEN WE UM WE WOULD KNOW HOW MUCH WATER IT WOULD HOLD
IF YOU PUT 'EM ALL OVER THE PLACE THEN IT WON'T STAY UP THAT HARD FAR AND IT'LL JUST SINK BUT IF YOU PUT THEM LIKE IN THE MIDDLE AND STACK 'EM YOU CAN FIT MORE PENNIES
WE MADE FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES TO SEE UM WHICH ONE WOULD
UM LET'S SEE IF YOU DROP THE PENNIES IN YOU CAN HAVE LESS YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE LESS AND IF YOU STACK 'EM ON ONE SIDE YOU CAN HAVE MORE BUT IF YOU STACK 'EM ON THE EDGE IT'LL TIP OVER AND YOU COULD HAVE LESS
THE S THE SMALLER ONES WELL THE SMALLER ONE WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND THE BIGGERS ONE WILL
IF YOU PUT 'EM ALL ON ONE SIDE IT'LL SINK BUT IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE THEY'LL STAY EVEN AND YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES
TO HOLD PENNIES AND SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD
<BREATH> WELL WE PUT
WE MADE FOUR PAPER BOATS AND SEE HOW MANY HOW MUCH WATER THEY CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES IT CAN HOLD
PAPER CUPS
BETTER AND HOLD MORE
IF YOU MADE THEM ALL THE SAME YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU MADE 'EM A SMALLER OR BIGGER SIZE THAT THEY COULD HOLD MORE OR LESS
F YOU DROP THEM IN IT MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH BUT IF YOU SET 'EM IN AND YOU KEEP THEM EVEN IT'LL HOLD MORE
THANK YOU
IF YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE IT'LL SINK AND IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES
THEY'RE NOT ALL THE SAME THEY'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT <BREATH> A LITTLE DIFFERENT WAY
IF IT'S SHORTER IT WILL GO FAST SLOWER
I FORGOT
UM LET'S SEE THE BIGGER THE LONGER ONES TAKE LONGER TO GO BACK AND FORTH SO IT'S NOT AS MUCH AS IT'S A SHORTER ONE
<BREATH> IF YOU CHANGED TOO MANY VARIABLES AT ONCE THEN YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IF YOU CHANGED TOO MANY AND IT MIGHT NOT WORK
HOW MANY TIMES THE PENDULUM SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
SINCE IT'S SMALLER IT GOES FASTER
A FEW DAYS AGO WE FLEW PAPER AIRPLANES
I DON'T KNOW
HELLO
ACTUALLY THE BIGGER IT GETS THE MORE SWINGS IT HAS
WE TAPED A PENCIL TO OUR DESK AND THEN WE LET IT SWING BACK AND FORTH AND SEE HOW MUCH HOW MANY TIMES IT SWING IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH UM IN TWELVE SECONDS
<BREATH> THE SHORTER IT GETS THE FA- THE MORE SWINGS IT DOES IT TAKES
IT'S LIKE THE OTHER ONE THE SHORTER THE STRING IS THEN THE HIGHER THE AMOUNT OF SWINGS ARE
THIS ONE'S LONGER THAT THE OTHERS AND UM YOU ONLY SHOULD CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME
UM WE MADE A PENNY WITH SO IT WENT BACK AND FORTH LIKE A PENDULUM
CAUSE IF YOU CHANGED TOO MANY THINGS AT ONE TIME IT YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE CHANGED TOO MANY THINGS
THEY BOTH HAVE A PENNY AT THE END
IT MEANS THAT THE WATER HAS OR WHATEVER OTHER LIQUID HAS EVAPORATED OFF THE SURFACE
THE WATER IS EVAPORATING OVER THE COURSE OF TIME IF IT IS LEFT FOR ONLY FIFTEEN MINUTES THE SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER WILL EVAPORATE IF IT IS LEFT FOR THIRTY MINUTES MORE WATER WILL EVAPORATE IF IT IS LEFT FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES ALMOST ALL OF THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE AND IF IT IS LEFT FOR AN HOUR ALL OF THE WATER WILL EVAPORATE
WATER THAT EVAPORATES FORMS INTO WATER VAPOR WHICH IS A CLOUD OF VERY TINY WATER DROPLETS THAT ARE FAR APART THIS WATER VAPOR CAN CONDENSE INTO LARGER DROPS AND FALL FROM THE SKY WHICH IS KNOWN AS PRECIPITATION
WATER AS A GAS IS THE <BREATH> LIGHTEST OF THE THREE STATES OF WATER THIS IS BECAUSE THE MOLECULES ARE VERY FAR APART FROM EACH OTHER CAUSING YOU TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH IT WITHOUT ANY NOTION OF IT BEING THERE
WATER IN THE AIR CAN HAVE MANY SHAPES THIS IS BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING TO HOLD IT IN IF IT IS POURED INTO A CONTAINER OR A CONTAINER IS FILLED WITH IT AND SEALED IT WILL TAKE THE SHAPE OF THE CONTAINER
THE WATER WHEN IT'S HEATED TURNS INTO TINY DROPLETS WHICH ARE RISE INTO THE AIR AND CONDENSE WHERE THEY CAN FORM A CLOUD AND PRECIPITATE
BYE
<BREATH> A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WATER IS A GAS AND IS WARM THIS IS WHAT YOU SEE AS STEAM WHEN SOMETHING IS BOILING <BREATH> WATER VAPOR ALSO CAN BE COLD BECAUSE IT IS HIGH UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND IS CONDENSING
IT LOOKS LIKE A THIN GRAY MIST ALTHOUGH WHEN IN VERY LARGE PORTIONS IT LOOKS LIKE A WHITE CLOUD WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHAT IT IS
I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS WATER VAPOR OR TINY DROPLETS OF WATER THAT ARE VERY FAR APART
WE PUT THE LID ON ONE PLASTIC CUP BECAUSE IT COULD NOT EVAPORATE AND ESCAPE WE LEFT THE OTHER ONE OPEN BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED AND COMPARE THE TWO CUPS
I OBSERVED THAT OVER TIME THE LI THE CUP WITH THE COVERED LID BECAME HEAVIER BECAUSE THE WATER IN THE UNCOVERED CUP EVAPORATED OUT WELL THE ONE WITH THE COVERED CUP THE WATER STAYED IN
<BREATH> WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW ICE EXPANDS WHEN IT'S FROZEN WELL WATER EXPANDS
<BREATH> THE WATER IS EVAPORATING OFF THE SURFACE CAUSING THE AMOUNT OF WATER TO SHRINK
WE PUT ONE WET PAPER TOWEL IN AN UNCOVERED CUP AND THE OTHER WET PAPER TOWEL IN A COVERED CUP MY PREDICTION IS THAT THE ONE WITH THE UNCOVERED CUP WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE ROOM WELL THE ONE THAT HA IS IN THE COVERED CUP WILL EVAP- AND CONDENSE ON THE TOP OF THE CUP
GOOD
WE COULD SLOW DOWN EVAPORATION BY EITHER PUTTING WATER IN A COLD CONTAINER WHICH WOULD STOP WATER DROPLETS FROM BEING FORMED AND RISING OR WE COULD SEAL THE CONTAINER SO IT COULD NOT ESCAPE
EVAPORATION IS THE PROCESS OF A LIQUID TURNING TO A GAS SOMETIMES A SOLID CAN TURN STRAIGHT TO A GAS IF IT IS PUT UNDER HIGH TEMPERATURES
THE CORK STOPPER AND THE WOODEN BALL ARE FLOATING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE MUCH LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER IF THEY WERE MORE DENSE IT WOULD BE LIKE THE STONE THE PAPER CLIP AND PENNY AND WOULD HAVE SUNK
COLD WATER IS MORE DENSE THAN ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER CAUSING IT TO SINK IT CANNOT SINK TO THE BOTTOM BECAUSE THE BOTTOM OF THE VIAL IS BLOCKING IT
WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING THINGS IN WATER TO SEE IF THEY FLOAT OR SINK THINGS THAT FLOAT ARE LESS DENSE THAN WATER THINGS THAT SINK ARE MORE DENSE THAN WATER
IT'S GOING GOOD
OBJECTS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP ARE MORE DENSE THAN WATER SO THEY SINK <BREATH> THIS IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO AIR SPACE AND DISPLACE M MORE WATER THAN THEY WEIGH
IT TELLS ME THAT IT IS MORE DENSE THAN WATER ALSO IF SOMETHING IS THE SAME DENSITY OF THE WATER IT WILL HANG SUSPENDED BETWEEN THE SURFACE AND THE BOTTOM
THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN WATER I CAN TELL THIS BECAUSE IT FLOATS ON TOP OF THE WATER
WE PUT HOT WATER AND A A GLASS VIAL AND LOWERED IT INTO THE WATER THE RED FOOD COLORED HOT WATER CAME OUT OF THE TOP PROVING THAT HOT WATER IS LESS DENSE THAN ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER
I NOTICED THAT <BREATH> THE HOT WATER WENT INTO THE TOP OF THE WATER IN THE GLASS IMMEDIATELY FORMING A CLOUD THAT WE COULD SEE BECAUSE OF THE FOOD COLORING HOWEVER WHEN YOU LET IT SIT AND THE TEMPERATURE'S CHANGED THE RED FOOD COLORING DISPERSED
<BREATH> THE HOT WATER FLOATED BECAUSE IT WAS LESS DENSE THAN WATER <BREATH> AT ROOM TEMPERATURE THIS WE COULD SEE ONLY BECAUSE OF FOOD COLORING WE ADDED TO THE WATER
THE DENSITY WIL OF THE CORK RELATES TO THE DENSITY OF THE HOT WATER BECAUSE THE HOT WATER WAS LESS THAN STILL WATER CAUSING IT TO F RISE TO THE TOP AND THE CORK WAS LESS DENSE THAN WATER CAUSING IT TO RISE TO THE TOP OR FLOAT
WE PUT THESE OBJECTS IN THE CONTAINER OF WATER <BREATH> THE RUBBER STOPPER AND THE PENNY SUNK
<BREATH> THE RED WATER IS RISING TO THE TOP THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS HOT AND LESS DENSE THAN THE ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER WHICH IS THE WATER IN THE MIDDLE AND BOTTOM OF THE GLASS
<BREATH> HERE THE COLD WATER IN THE VIAL IS STAYING IN THE VIAL BECAUSE IT IS MORE DENSE THAN THE ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER THAT SURROUNDS IT IT IS TRYING <BREATH> TO SINK THE BOTTOM OF THE VIAL IS CAUSING IT TO BE STOPPED
I OBSERVED THAT THE WATER CAME OUT THE TOP LIKE A VOLCANO FORMING CLOUDS AT THE TOP OF THE VI OF THE CUP OF WATER
THESE OBJECTS ARE FLOATERS BECAUSE THEY FLOAT THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER AN EXAMPLE THE CORK HAS LOTS OF AIR SPACE CAUSING IT TO FLOAT THE SAME THING WITH THE RUBBER STOPPER AND THE WOODEN BALL
IT MEANS THAT AN OBJECT HAS AIR SPACE OR DISPLACES LESS WATER THAN <BREATH> IT <BREATH> WEIGHS THIS IS WHY THEY FLOAT ON THE SURFACE
<BREATH> COLD WATER <BREATH> IS MORE DENSE <BREATH> THAN ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER THE SAME THING WITH THE STONE THE PAPER CLIP AND THE PENNY THIS CAUSES IT TO <BREATH> SINK TO THE BOTTOM BUT IT CANNOT SINK BECAUSE THE BOTTOM OF THE VIAL IS BLOCKING IT
THE OBJECTS ON TOP OF THE WATER ARE FLOATING CAUSE THEY'RE LESS DENSE THAN WATER THIS USUALLY MEANS THAT THEY HAVE AIR SPACE IN THEM OR THEY DISPLACE M LESS WATER THAN THEIR WEIGHT
BYE
THE CORK THE RUBBER STOPPER AND THE BALL ARE FLOATING IN THE CONTAINER OF WATER TO THE LEFT THIS IS BECAUSE THEY'RE <BREATH> THEY ARE LESS DENSE THAN WATER IN THE CONTAINER TO THE RIGHT THE PENNY THE STONE AND THE PAPER CLIP ARE SINKING BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER
I NOTICED THAT HOT WATER CAME OUT OF THE VIAL AND IMMEDIATELY ROSE TOWARDS THE TOP FORMING A RED CLOUD THAT YOU COULD SEE BECAUSE OF THE FOOD COLORING <BREATH>
I FOUND OUT THAT THEY ARE LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER
IT TOLD ME THAT IT WAS LESS DENSE THAN WATER
THEY ARE SITTING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE DENSE THAN WATER
SORT OF
EVAPORATION AT LOW TEMPERATURES TAKES MUCH LONGER BECAUSE ONE THE WATER CAN FREEZE AND STOP EVAPORATION ALTOGETHER UNLESS HEATED QUICKLY AND TWO THE WATER MOLECULES AREN'T MOVING AS QUICKLY WHICH MEANS IT TAKES LONGER FOR THEM TO SPREAD OUT AND TURN INTO A GAS
IT TELLS ME THAT LOCATION D IS THE COLDEST LOCATION D I MEAN C IS THE SECOND COLDEST LOCATION A IS THE SECOND WARMEST AND LOCATION B IS THE WARMEST
WE TOOK THE AIR TEMPERATURE AND PUT THEM IN THE PLACES WHERE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO GO EVERY MORNING AND EVERY AFTERNOON FOR FOUR DAYS WE WILL CHECK THE AIR TEMPERATURE AND SEE HOW MUCH WATER HAS EVAPORATED
WE HAVE FILLED CUPS WITH WATER AND PUT THEM IN DIFFERENT PLACES AROUND THE ROOM SUCH AS ON THE WINDOW SILL IN THE REFRIGERATOR <BREATH> BY A COMPUTER AND IN THE CEILING
I THINK THAT WARM <BREATH> TEMPERATURES MAKE WATER EVAPORATE QUICKLY BECAUSE <BREATH> WHEN THE WATER IS HEATED ITS MOLECULES MOVE QUICKLY CAUSING IT TO SPREAD OUT AND TURN INTO A GAS
THE TEMPERATURES IN CUP C AND D <BREATH> ARE THE LOWEST BUT THEY HAVE ALSO LOST THE LEAST AMOUNT OF WATER
I OBSERVE THAT AFTER TIME THE WIND FROM THE FAN CAUSED WATER TO EVAPORATE QUICKLY
IT TELLS ME THAT THE CUP IN THE FRONT OF THE COMPUTER COULD EVAPORATE QUICKLY BECAUSE THERE'S WIND BLOWING O OVER IT FROM THE FAN IN THE COMPUTER IT COULD ALSO EVAPORATE SLOWLY BECAUSE IT IS HUMID IN RIGHT BY THE COMPUTER THE CUP IN THE CEILING WILL PROBABLY EVAPORATE SLOWLY CAUSE IT IS <BREATH> VERY COOL AND IT COULD EVAPORATE QUICKLY BECAUSE IT IS DRY IN THE CEILING THE CUP IN THE REFRIGERATOR WILL PROBABLY NOT EVAPORATE MUCH AT ALL BECAUSE IT IS VERY COLD AND NOT TOO HUMID AND THE CUP WAIT
THERE IS A LOT LESS EVAPORATION IN THE JUNGLE THAN IN THE DESERT IN FACT ONLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE WATER IN THE JUNGLE CUP WAS LOST WELL ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE WATER IN THE DESERT CUP WAS LOST
A DESERT IS VERY HOT BUT VERY DRY A JUNGLE IS ALSO VERY HOT BUT IS VERY HUMID THIS IS WHEN THERE IS A LOT OF WATER VAPOR IN THE AIR
WHEN THE AIR IS FULL OF MOISTURE <BREATH> WATER CAN EVAPORATE QUICKLY BECAUSE THERE ARE IS MORE WATER VAPOR IN THE AIR ALSO AS I SAID EARLIER WATER VAPOR TENDS TO OCCUR NEAR WARM PLACES
WE CHOSE THE REFRIGERATOR CAUSE IT IS VERY COLD WE CHOSE THE WINDOW SILL CAUSE IT GETS A LOT OF HEAT AND LIGHT WE CHOSE THE CEILING BECAUSE IT IS DRY AND CAN BE COLD OR WARM AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE CHOSE BY A COMPUTER BECAUSE IT CAN BE WARM BUT SOMETIMES MOIST BY A COMPUTER
<BREATH> I THINK THAT WARM PLACES WILL HAVE
WHEN IT IS WINDY MUCH MORE WATER IS LOST THAN WHEN IT IS JUST IN A PLAIN ROOM IF IT WAS IN FRONT OF AN EVEN STRONGER FAN I THINK IT WOULD LOSE MORE WATER THAN IN FRONT OF THE REGULAR FAN
BYE
I THINK THAT PLACES WITH WARM TEMPERATURES WILL MAKE WATER EVAPORATE MORE QUICKLY WELL PLACES WITH COOL TEMPERATURES WILL MAKE WATER EVAPORATE SLOWLY
<BREATH> NO I DO NOT REMEMBER THE TEMPERATURE
I THINK THAT EVAPORATION IN A MORE HUMID PLACE WOULD BE EASIER THAN IN A VERY DRY PLACE BECAUSE WITH ALL THE WATER VAPOR IN THE AIR ALMOST EVERYTHING IS WET AND THEREFORE THERE IS ONE A HIGHER CHANCE OF SOMETHING TURNING TO WATER VAPOR AND T TWO THE WATER VAPOR IN THE AIR COULD WARM THE LIQUID WATER CAUSING IT TO TURN INTO A GAS
I SEE THAT <BREATH> THE TEMPERATURE'S THE SAME IN THE JUNGLE AS IN THE DESERT <BREATH> BUT IN THE DESERT MORE WATER EVAPORATED AND IN THE JUNGLE LESS WATER EVAPORATED
WIND IS BL- FROM THE FAN IS BLOWING THE WATER IN THE CUP THIS CAN SPEED UP EVAPORATION BECAUSE AS IT IS BLOWN THE WATER MOLECULES ARE ALL MOVING ONE WAY BUT SOMETIMES AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS AWAY FROM EACH OTHER THIS CAUSES WATER MOLECULES TO SPREAD OUT AND TURN INTO A GAS
GOOD
<BREATH> THE SUNLIGHT TRAVELING DOWN ONTO THE LANDSCAPE WILL EVAPORATE SOME OF THE WATER IN THE RIVER AND OCEAN THIS WILL CONDENSATE IN THE AIR ONCE IT HAS RISEN AND FORM CLOUDS WHICH WILL RAIN GO
<BREATH> IT TURNS INTO BEADS OF WATER THAT ARE USUALLY SPREAD FAR APART OR ARE VERY BY AND FORM ALMOST A FOG LIKE SURFACE ON THE EDGE OF THE CUP
<BREATH> I WOULD DESCRIBE WATER BEFORE IT EVAPORATES AS A LIQUID AND A LIQUID THAT WHEN SPREAD ON TO A FLAT SURFACE SPREADS OUT INTO <BREATH> LARGE SEAS THAT HA ARE NOT CONTINUOUS
<BREATH> WATER EVAPORATED FROM THE WATER IN THE CUP IS TURNING TO WATER VAPOR BUT WHEN IT TOUCHES THE COLD SURFACE OF THE TOP OF THE CUP IT'S TURNING TO DROPLETS AND STAYING THERE THEREFORE CONDENSING THE WATER
THE WATER ON THE TABLE IS EVAPORATING
BEFORE YOU PUT THE ICE IN THERE'S NO CONDENSATION AFTER YOU PUT THE ICE IN AND IT IS VERY COLD THERE'S LOTS OF CONDENSATION BECAUSE THE WATER VAPOR IS TURNING TO LIQUID SINCE IT IS SO COLD ON THE ED OUTSIDE OF THE CUP
IT IS IN A GAS STATE
GOOD
GOOD
IT COMES FROM THE WATER SITTING IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP
<BREATH> THESE TWO CUPS ARE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES THE ONE WITH ICE IN IT IS COLD THE ONE THAT IS GREEN IS ROOM TEMPERATURE WHEN WATER VAPOR MEETS A COOL SURFACE IT CONDENSATES ON THE SURFACE THIS IS WHY THERE ARE TINY <BREATH> DROPLETS OF WATER ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BLUE COLD CUP
<BREATH> WATER VAPOR IN THE AIR CONDENSATES ON THE EDGE AND OUTSIDE OF WHATEVER IS COLDER THAN THE AIR
THAT MEANS THAT THE BLUE CUP IS COLDER THAN THE GREEN CUP AND COLDER THAN THE SURROUNDING AIR
BYE MARNIE
<BREATH> THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CUP WHERE YOU SEE WATER DROPLETS IS CLOSER TO FIFTY OR FORTY
THE WATER EVAPORATED FROM THE CUP FULL OF WATER IS TRAPPED INSIDE THE CUP THIS MEANS IT HAS NO PLACE TO GO IT STILL RISES BUT WHEN IT TOUCHES THE COOL SURFACE OF THE LID IT CONDENSES INTO TINY DROPLETS
GOOD
<BREATH> KIND OF MATERIALS THAT EVAPORATE ARE LIQUIDS THAT THAT CAN SPREAD OUT AT A LOWER TEMPERATURE IF YOU NEED A VERY HIGH TEMPERATURE TO GET THEM TO TURN INTO A GAS THEN THEY'RE NOT NORMALLY IN THE FORM OF THE G OF A GAS BUT IN THE FORM OF A LIQUID OR SOLID BUT WATER IS THE ONLY FORM OF LI OF MATTER THAN CAN BE FOUND NATURALLY IN BOTH SOLID LIQUID AND GAS
<BREATH> THE STATE OF WATER AFTER CONDENSATION IS IN IS WATER IN ITS LIQUID FORM IN WATER IN ITS LIQUID FORM EITHER TAKES THE FORM OF A SEA THAT SPREADS INTO DEEP AREAS OR IT TAKES THE FORM OF TINY DROPLETS SPREAD OVER A SURFACE OR ON THE SIDES OR TOP OF A SURFACE
WHEN WE ADDED WATER TO GRAVEL IT QUICKLY DRAINED OR EVAPORATED IN FACT WE FELT BOTH THE SOIL AND THE GRAVEL AFTER A LITTLE WHILE AND THE SOIL WAS STILL WET IN SOME PLACES WELL THE GRAVEL WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY DRY
<BREATH> I COULD TELL BECAUSE <BREATH> EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS LESS GRAVEL THEY'RE EQUAL WEIGHTS AND WE POURED THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER INTO EACH THAT IS WHY HOW I CAN TELL THAT THAT SOIL ABSORBED MORE WATER
I SEE TWO EQUAL PILES OF DIRT OR SOIL AND ROCKS OR GRAVEL
BYE MARNIE
GOOD
I WOULD USE SOIL THAT ABSORBED A LOT OF THE WATER THAT FELL INTO IT BUT DIDN'T TURN TO MUD BECAUSE IF IT TURNED TO MUD IT WOULD BE HARD FOR THE PLANT TO S STAND UP AND GROW BUT IF THERE WAS A LOT OF WATER IN IT BUT IT WASN'T MUD THEN THEY COULD GROW WELL AND IN OUR DRY CLIMATE EVEN THOUGH THEY NEEDED LOTS OF WATER
<BREATH> I KNOW THAT GRAVEL DOESN'T FIT TOGETHER VERY WELL AND IS VERY HARD I KNOW THAT SOIL HAS A BUNCH OF TINY PIECES THAT FIT TOGETHER WELL AND CAN ABSORB WATER BECAUSE IT IS A SPONGY MATERIAL WITH LOTS OF PLACES FOR WATER TO GO AND SOAK IN
<BREATH> THE WATER THAT DOESN'T COME THROUGH THE SOIL EITHER IS COMPLETELY ABSORBED AND THEN EVAPORATES OR EVAPORATES BECAUSE THE SOIL IS SATURATED AND IT CANNOT BE S SOAKED IN THE THE SOIL
<BREATH> WE PUT WATER IN TWO CUPS THAT ONE THAT HAD SOIL AND ONE THAT HAD GRAVEL THE CUPS HAD HOLES IN THEM AND THEY DRIPPED INTO LARGER CUPS
WE COULD FIND MATERIALS LIKE SOIL IN MANY PLACES SUCH AS A HOME GARDEN <BREATH> OR ON OPEN FIELDS IN PLAINS WE CAN FIND LOTS OF GRAVEL ON MOUNTAIN SIDES OR IN DESERTS
<BREATH> YOU CAN RECORD AND USE YOUR OBSERVATIONS FOR MAKING A GARDEN IF YOU WANTED A GARDEN THAT HAD PLANTS THAT YOU NEEDED HUMIDITY AND LARGE ROOTS THEN YOU WOULD WANT SOIL THAT ABSORBED A LOT OF WATER IF YOU HAD PLANTS LIKE CACTUSES THEN YOU WOULD <BREATH> WANT A A GARDEN THAT HAD LOTS OF GRAVEL SO OH IT COULD EITHER SOAK THROUGH IMMEDIATELY OR BE SUCKED UP VERY QUICKLY BY THE PLANTS THAT LIVE IN A DRY ENVIRONMENT
WHEN WE ADDED WATER TO GRAVEL IT SEEPED THROUGH QUICKLY AND DRIPPED VERY RAPIDLY THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP THIS CAUSED THERE TO BE A LOT OF WATER IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP
THE WATER IN THE GRAVEL CUP HAS DRAINED THROUGH QUICKLY AND HAS DRAINED THROUGH MORE THAN THE WATER IN THE SOIL CUP ALSO IF THERE WAS A GRAPH I BELIEVE THAT THE SOIL WOULD HAVE TAKEN LONGER TO DRIP THE THIRTY FIVE MILLILITERS THAN THE GRAVEL TOOK TO DRIP THE FORTY MILLILITERS
<BREATH> FROM THE INFORMATION IN THIS TABLE IF I GET A HUNDRED MILLILITER RAIN AND I HAVE A GRAVEL UM LAWN THEN I CAN TELL WHAT IS GOING TO DRAIN THROUGH OR NOT SO I CAN PLAN TO SEE IF MY BASEMENT WILL BE FLOODED OR NOT
<BREATH> IT COMPARES CLOSELY BUT STILL HAS A LOT MORE WATER <BREATH> BECAUSE YOU POURED FIFTY MILLILITERS INTO EACH ONE UM EIGHTY PERCENT OF THAT DRAINED THROUGH THE ROCKS WELL ONLY AROUND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT DRAINED THROUGH THE G SOIL
WHEN WE ADDED WATER TO THE SOIL THE SOIL IMMEDIATELY BECAME WET AND SOGGY LIKE MUD <BREATH> THEN THE SOIL STARTED DRIPPING AND DRIED OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY THE ROCKS DID NOT ABSORB ANY WATER AND THEREFORE DRIPPED THROUGH ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
<BREATH> THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT DRAINED THROUGH THE GRAVEL IS FORTY MILLILITERS THIS IS FIVE MILLILITERS MORE THAN WHAT SOAKED THROUGH THE SOIL
THE SOIL IS MUCH HEAVIER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE IT SOAKED UP THAT WATER AND IS STILL CONTAINED IN THE SOIL THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WATER THAT DIDN'T EVAPORATE AND THE GRAVEL ALL THE WATER EITHER S WENT THROUGH OR EVAPORATED IMMEDIATELY
WHEN YOU POUR ONTO AN EARTH MATERIAL IT WILL SOMETIMES DRAIN THROUGH QUICKLY SOMETIMES BE PARTIALLY ABSORBED BUT PARTIALLY DRIP THROUGH AND SOMETIMES WILL BE COMPLETELY ABSORBED
GOOD
<BREATH> WHEN YOU COOL WATER IT ACTUALLY CONTRACTS BUT WHEN IT REACHES AROUND THIRTY EIGHT DEGREES FAHRENHEIT IT ACTUALLY EXPANDS AND AS IT GETS COLDER EXPANDS MORE AND MORE
MOVING WATER IS OFTEN FOUND IN RIVERS AND IN WATERFALLS IT CAN ALSO BE FOUND IN GEYSERS OR IN OCEAN CURRENTS DEEP BENEATH THE SURFACE OR AT THE SURFACE
<BREATH> WE MADE A WATER WHEEL TO HELP US LIFT A PAPER CLIP
<BREATH> THE STRING AND PAPER CLIP ARE BEING HOISTED UP BECAUSE THE WATER WHEEL IS TURNING
IT TELLS ME THAT WATER WHEELS CAN LIFT HEAVY OBJECTS WITH ONLY A LITTLE AMOUNT OF FORCE WE CAN DO THIS BECAUSE WE USED A SH SYRINGE TO PUSH THE BLADES OF THE WATER WHEEL
MARNIE YOU'VE ALREADY ASKED ME THAT QUESTION
IT TELLS ME THAT A WATER WHEEL CAN LIFT HEAVY WEIGHTS WITH ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF ENERGY IF WE HAD ADDED A PULLEY SYSTEM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE EFFICIENT BUT WOULD HAVE TAKEN <BREATH> LONGER TO LIFT THE OBJECT
THAT'S OKAY MARNIE
<BREATH> THE WATER WHEEL IN CLASS DID A MUCH SIMILAR THING TO THIS WATER WHEEL THE ENERGY FROM THE WATER BEING POURED THE KINETIC ENERGY IS PUSHING THE WATER WHEEL WHICH CONVERTS THAT ENERGY INTO A PULLING ENERGY THAT HOIST THE PAPER CLIP
THIS PICTURE IS A MILL THAT IS USING WATER TO TURN A WATER WHEEL THAT WILL MOVE GRINDSTONES TO TURN WHEAT INTO FLOUR HE THE MILLER SELLS THE FLOUR THEREFORE EARNS HIS MONEY
THE SHAFT IS WHAT TURNS WHEN THE WATER WHEEL IS SPINNING THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO SEPARATE SHAFTS ONE IS A DOWEL AND ONE IS A STRAW THE WATER WHEEL TURNS THE STRAW WHICH IS TIED ON TO THE DOWEL SO THE DOWEL TURNS WHICH AND ABLE TO LIFT THINGS
<BREATH> WE STUCK THE STRAW THROUGH ONE OF THE RED DISCS AND PUT FOUR RED DISCS ONE ON EACH CORNER OF THE MIDDLE RED DISC THEN WE STUCK THE STRAW OVER THE TOP OF THE BOX WITH WATER IN IT AND YOU STRING TO TIE TO HOIST ONE OF THE PAPER CLIPS UP THE STRAW
GOOD HOW ARE YOU MARNIE
WHEN THE WATER PUSHES ON THE BLADES OF THE WATER WHEEL IT THE WATER WHEEL SPINS AND CAN LIFT OBJECTS IF THEY ARE CRANKED AROUND THE DOWEL OR STRAW THIS IS HOW WE LIFTED OBJECTS OFF THE FLOOR
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARNIE BYE SEE YOU NEXT YEAR OR LATER THIS YEAR
HI MARNIE
WE LIFTED THINGS WITH A WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW MUCH WATER IT TOOK TO LIFT A SMALL ITEM AND A BIG ITEM IT TOOK MORE WATER TO LIFT A LARGER ITEM AND LESS WATER TO LIFT A SMALLER ITEM
YES I THINK PUDDLES EVAPORATE QUITE A LOT MORE IN THE SUNSHINE
WATER EVAPORATE
THE WATER ON THE SURFACE IS EXPOSED TO THE AIR
TRUE SOME LAKES ARE VERY DEEP BUT THEY DO HAVE A VERY LARGE SURFACE AREA IN FACT USUALLY THE DEEPER YOU GET ON SOMETHING THE LARGER THE SURFACE AREA IS
THAT'S OKAY I THINK THAT WATER WOULD EVAPORATE QUICKER IN COLORADO BECAUSE IT IS DRY AND THEREFORE THERE'S NOT AS MUCH MOISTURE IN THE AIR <BREATH> IN THE JUNGLES IT WOULD BE ABOUT THE SAME TEMPERATURE BUT WOULD BE MUCH MORE HUMID HUMID IS ALSO WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF MOISTURE IN THE AIR USUALLY IN THE FORM OF WATER VAPOR
YES I CAN WHEN YOU SEE A LAKE USUALLY IT HAS A LOT OF SURFACE AREA BUT ISN'T VERY DEEP WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE A WELL THEN IT HAS LITTLE SURFACE AREA BUT IS VERY DEEP
GOOD
<BREATH> USUALLY IN THE SUNSHINE IT IS WARM VERY WARM WHEN THINGS ARE WARM SUCH AS WATER THEIR MOLECULES MOVE QUICKLY AND TAKE UP MORE SPACE THIS CAUSES DROPLETS OF WATER TO EXPAND AND CAN TURN INTO A GAS IF THEY EXPAND THE RIGHT AMOUNT
YES I HAVE SEEN PUDDLES OF WATER EVAPORATE WHEN IT RAINS WE HAVE UH UNSLOPED SIDEWALK IN THE FRONT OF OUR HOUSE AND THERE ARE A LOTS OF PUDDLES ON IT SOMETIMES I USED TO GO OUT AND PLAY IN THEM THEN WHEN I CAME OUT FROM DOING SOMETHING INSIDE MO MO MOST OF THEM WERE GONE
I FOUND OUT THAT D HAS THE MOST SURFACE A A HAS THE LEAST SURFACE AREA B HAS THE SECOND MOST SURFACE AREA AND C HAS THE SECOND LEAST SURFACE AREA
WHEN IT IS VERY HUMID IT IS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF WATER VAPOR IN THE AIR THIS WATER VAPOR CAN AFFECT WATER THAT IS EVAPORATING BECAUSE THE WATER THAT'S ALREADY EVAPORATED IS M MORE DENSE THAN AIR THEN THERE IS MORE WEIGHT PUSHING DOWN ON THE WATER CAUSING THE WATER TO STOP FROM RISING WHEN IT IS DRY THERE'S NOT ANY OF THAT HUMIDITY PUSHING DOWN ON THE WATER
WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW SURFACE AREA AFFECTS HOW MUCH WATER IN A CUP EVAPORATES
YES LOTS OF OTHER THINGS ABOUT EVAPORATION OTHER THAN SURFACE AREA SURFACE AREA EFFECTS EVAPORATION AS WE KNOW HEAT EFF- EFFECTS EVAPORATION AND HUMIDITY EFFECTS EVAPORATION
THE WATER ON THE SURFACE IS TOUCHING THE AIR IF WATER IS TOUCHING THE AIR IT EVAPORATES QUICKER THE MORE WATER TOUCHING THE AIR THE FASTER SOMETHING WILL EVAPORATE
CONTAINER D LOST ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER THEY ALL HAD THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER IN THEM AND THEY ALL LOST HALF THE MILLILITERS OF THE SQUARE CENTIMETERS THAT THE AREA WAS FOR THE TOP
YOU'RE WELCOME
<BREATH> THE MORE WATER THAT IS TOUCHING THE AIR THE FASTER THE WATER EVAPORATES WHEN WATER TOUCHES THE AIR IT EITHER HEATS UP OR COOLS DOWN IF IT IS HEATING UP WHICH IS THE MOST COMMON EFFECT THEN IT WILL TEND TO SPREAD OUT AND EVAPORATE THE MORE S SQUARE INCHES OR CENTIMETERS THAT ARE DOING THIS AT ONCE THE QUICKER IT EVAPORATES
NO NOTHING HAS SURPRISED ME QUITE YET
IT WENT MEAN THAT CONTAINER D WOULD EVAPORATE FASTER THAN ALL THE OTHER CONTAINERS
IF THEY HAVE DIFFERENT SURFACE AREAS THEY WILL EVAPORATE AT DIFFERENT RATES THE MORE SURFACE AREA THE FASTER SOMETHING WILL EVAPORATE IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S VERY DEEP BUT HAS LITTLE SURFACE AREA THEN IT WILL EVAPORATE SLOWLY IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS VERY SHALLOW BUT F HAS A LOT OF SURFACE AREA THEN IT WILL EVAPORATE QUICKLY
TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER CONTAINERS ALL HAVE DIFFERENT SURFACE AREAS CONTAINER D HAS A SURFACE AREA OF TWO HUNDRED SQUARE CENTIMETERS CONTAINER C HAS A SURFACE AREA OF TWENTY FOUR SQUARE CENTIMETERS CONTAINER B HAS A SURFACE AREA OF A HUNDRED SQUARE CENTIMETERS AND CONTAINER A HAS A SURFACE AREA OF SIXTEEN SQUARE CENTIMETERS
WHEN YOU HAVE SMALL SURFACE AREAS THEN WATER EVAPORATES SLOWLY BECAUSE NOT MUCH WATER IS TOUCHING THE AIR FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAD A CONTAINER THAT ONLY HAD ONE SQUARE CENTIMETER OF SURFACE AREA THEN IT WOULD EVAPORATE EXTREMELY SLOWLY
SOMEONE IS DRUMMING THE-
NO
I SEE SOME APPLES A JAR A CANDLE SOME WOOD AND I DON’T KNOW WITH THE OTHER THING IS
I THINK THAT THE GIRL IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE APPLE SHE IS EATING TO WALK
THE COAL AND GAS POLLUTES THE AIR
I SEE A CANDLE BURNING
I SEE THAT THE WAS- THE WAX IS MELTING
<SIDE_SPEECH> NOTHING
THINK THAT THE LIGHT IS IMPORTANT
WE’VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE CIRCUITS
+AH UMM+
I DON’T KNOW
AIR GETS THE AIR GETS POLLUTED
I THINK THAT STUFF WILL MOVE
COAL AND GAS WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR
I DON’T KNOW
I SEE THAT THE WAX IS MELTING
BYE
I SEE THAT THE WAX IS MELTING
THE AIR AROUND IT GETS POLLUTED
I THINK THAT THERE THE AIR WILL BE POLLUTED
THE SOLAR CELL THE <INDISCERNIBLE>
YES
THEY ARE BOTH NON-RENEWABLE
STOP
I CAN HEAR IT AND-
OKAY
GOOD H OW ARE YOU
I SEE A FLAME
THE EVIDENCE IS THAT SHE IS- SHE HAS ENERGY TO WALK
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE NEED IT
I DON’T KNOW
IT’S IS MELTING THE WAX
SHE IS EATING AND WALKING
THEN IT CAN BE A MAGNET
THEY HAVE TO RUN
I CAN- WRAP- I DON’T KNOW
THERE ARE SOME OBJECTS
THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY IS CONTROL BY THE SWITCH BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OPENED THAT YOU CAN THE ELECTRICITY CANT FLOW
WHAT
THE SWITCH IS CONNECTED THE D-CELL AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SWITCH IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE D-CELL IS ALSO WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET AND THEN LIKE MOST SWITCH IS DOWN AND THE STEEL RIVET IS PICKING UP THE WASHERS
THE HAS TO BE MADE FROM STEEL
BECAUSE THE WIRE IS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET
<NO_SIGNAL>
IT MEANS THAT IT CAN PICK UP STUFF
I DO NOT KNOW
IT IS CLOSED
IT JUST STARTS
GOOD
I DO NOT KNOW
WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPENED THEN NO WASHERS ARE ON THE MAGNET BUT WHEN THAT IS CLOSED THEN OTHER WASHERS ARE
THAT MEANS SOMETIMES IT CAN PICK UP STUFF BUT SOMETIMES IT CAN’T
THE STEEL RIVET CAN PICK UP MANY WASHERS
I TOLD TO YOU A BILLION TIMES
ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY AND A STEEL RIVET MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
IT DOESN’T HAVE THE <INDISCERNIBLE>
WE’VE BEEN SEEING HOW RIVET CAN PICK UP WASHER
THE WIRES HAVE TO GO AROUND THE RIVET
IF SWITCH IS OPENED THEN THE STEEL THE MAGNET CAN’T PICK UP ANYTHING BUT IF THE SWITCH IS OPEN THEN THEN <SILENCE> ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW
JUST ROLL AROUND THE STEEL RIVET
LOTS OF ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE STEEL RIVET
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME ELECTRICITY TO MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET
ELECTRICITY HAS TO GO AROUND A STEEL RING AND IT CAN PICK UP STUFF
IT TURNS INTO AN ELECTROMAGNET YOU CAN PICK UP METALS
IT’S I DON’T KNOW OKAY
IT IS CLOSED
IT WILL +AH+ I DON'T KNOW
THERE’S LOTS OF ENERGY GOING THROUGH IT
IT TURNS INTO A MAGNET
WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MAGNET CAN PICK UP ANY WASHERS
I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
I DON’T KNOW
I THINK THAT IT WILL STUFF MEANS- (*)
I DON’T KNOW
THEY ARE MOVING TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY STICK TO EACH OTHER AND ONE MAGNET IS MOVING SO THE OTHER JUST COMES ON
THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL AND THAT MAKES THE STEEL NAIL A MAGNET
THE NAIL IS NOT MAGNET ANYMORE
THEY CANNOT GO THROUGH <INDISCERNIBLE>
BECAUSE- BECAUSE IT ISN’T THE NAIL I MEAN IT ISN’T A MAGNET ANYMORE
IT’S NOW A TEMPORARY MAGNET
I DO NOT KNOW
THEY ARE PRETTY STRONG MAGNETS SO THEY JUST STICK TOGETHER
I DON’T KNOW
I DO NOT KNOW
THE NAIL MAKES THE- THE MAGNET MAKES THE NAIL A TEMPORARY MAGNET
SOMETIMES IF THE THING IS TOO THICK THEN THE MAGNETS WON’T BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THAT THING
I DON’T KNOW
I REALLY DO NOT KNOW PLEASE TELL
WE TESTED IT
I DON’T KNOW
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY ATTRACT TO
I DID NOT HEAR WHAT YOU JUST SAID
IT ONLY STAYS AS A MAGNET FOR A SHORT TIME BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE THE MAGNET OFF THE STEEL NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET ANY-
THEY ARE VERY GOOD THEY ARE AWESOME
IT IS FLOWING
THERE IS ONE BULB THERE IS ONE D-CELL AND TWO BULBS
IT LAST LONG
I THINK THAT TOP RIGHT-
THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS IN THERE
THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS THERE IT’S SHORTER AND THE LIGHT ARE BRIGHTER HERE COMES THE MOST BEAUTIFULLY LADY
THEY HAVE TO SHARE A PATHWAY AND A D-CELL
IT IS GOING IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE
IT PATHWAY GOES TO THE BASE TO THE CASING +TA DA TA+
WE’VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
I NOTICED THAT IT GOES IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE YOU’RE THE MOST UGLIEST WOMAN <LAUGH>
THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS DIMMER
THAT IS WHY WE CALL DIRECT
I DO NOT HERE SO PLEASE SAY IT AGAIN
THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES IN BOTH OF THEM
I’M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES
THEY ARE LIKE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
THERE ARE TWO WHOLE PATHWAYS AND THEY ARE DONE
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LIGHT IS BRIGHT SO WE NEED A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
<NO_SIGNAL>
I THINK THAT THE BULB WILL BE BRIGHTER
THE FLOW IS GOING IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE
I THINK THAT THE BULBS WILL BE VERY VERY +VERY+ BEAUTIFUL AND BRIGHT AND YOU ARE THE BEAUTIFUL- THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY IN THE WORLD
EACH TYPE OF POSITIVE THERE ARE PATHWAY THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
THEY ARE ALL OR THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY
WHAT DID YOU SAY
WE’VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
I THINK THAT THE BEST WOULD BE THE SERIES CIRCUIT OF COURSE OR THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT OF COURSE
WHAT DID YOU SAY
IT TURNS GREEN
I TOLD YOU A BILLION TO TRILLION ABOUT BILLION TIMES THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
THE SERIES CIRCUIT
PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE BRIGHTER YOU ARE THE DEAFEST WOMEN <LAUGH>
NO
THE DIRECTION IT IS GOING IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND-
WE’VE BEEN WORKING WITH SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS I’VE TOLD YOU LIKE A BILLION TRILLION BILLION <LAUGH> TIMES YOU ARE THE MOST UGLIEST WOMEN IN THE-
I’M GOOD H OW ARE YOU
BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHARE THE PATHWAY
I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
THE ENERGY GOES DIRECTLY TO ONE- +OHH+ DIRECTLY TO ONE LIGHT THEN IT SHINES BUT I THINK-
IT’S ALWAYS GOING THROUGH ONE DIRECTION AND IT’S GOING INTO THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE
THEY ARE BRIGHTER
NO +OH+ YEAH- YEAH THERE IS ONE LIGHTBULB AND THE ONE TWO LIGHTBULBS +OH OH+
IT BURNS OUT VERY QUICKLY
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO SHARE EVENLY WITH BOTH OF THEM AND IT DOESN’T GO DIRECTLY AND IT ONLY GOES TO ONE LIGHTBULB
I THINK THAT IT WILL BECOME BRIGHTER
THEY DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT PATHWAY
THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
I TOLD YOU IT GOES OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE
ALWAYS GOES THROUGH THE BATTERY TO THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE BATTERY AND-
THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS AND ONE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT ARE BRIGHT
THERE ARE TWO
THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM LEFT IS BURNING OUT QUICKLY
THE TOP RIGHT
THERE ARE TWO PATH WAYS IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THE TOP ONES ARE BRIGHTER THAN THE BOTTOM ONES
BYE
WIRES CARRY ELECTRICITY IN THE CIRCUIT
I NOTICE THAT IT TURNED AROUND AND THE ELECTRICITY IS STILL FLOWING TOWARD INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
CONNECT THE LIGHT BULB TO THE BATTERY
THEY THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THEM AND THEY HELP THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
THE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND IT GOES INTO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT LIGHT
GOOD
ONE SIDE IS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND ONE SIDE IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE POSITIVE HAS A LITTLE BUMP ON IT AND IT GOES INTO THE ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND IT GOES OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE
(())
IT HAS
THE THE FLOW GOES THE OTHER WAY
UM THERE IS A LIGHT BULB A WIRE AND A D CELL BATTERY
UM IT HAS TO BE A COMPLETE CIRCLE ONE WIRE HAS TO TOUCH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND ONE WIRE HAS TO TOUCH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND ONE WIRE HAS TO TOUCH THE BULB BASE AND THE OTHER HAS TO TOUCH THE BULB CASING
THE WIRES ARE PATHWAY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOW TURNS AROUND JUST AS THE D CELL DOES
RECEIVES IT RECEIVES ELECTRICITY AND MAKES THE BULB LIGHT
THE ELECTRICITY WILL STOP FLOWING
IT IS A SOURCE
THEY REPRESENT ELECTRICITY
THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY IN THEM
IS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND IT HAS A BUMP ON IT
THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING TOWARD THE POSITIVE SIDE
IT GOES INTO IT GOES INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THEN IT GOES AROUND AND BACK IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL
SIDE THE NEGATIVE SIDE
THE POSITIVE SIDE THE WIRE THAT'S TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE IS ALSO TOUCHING THE BULB BASE AND THE WIRE THAT IS TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL IS TOUCHING THE BULB CASING
I NOTICE THAT IF ONE ONE WIRE IS ON THE BULB CASING ONE WIRE IS ON THE BASE THEN THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS BUT IF BOTH BUT IF BOTH OF THE WIRES ARE ON THE BULB BASE THEN THE LIGHT BULB WON'T LIGHT
THE THE POSITIVE SIDE THE WIRE THAT'S TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE IS ALSO TOUCHING THE BULB BASE AND THE WIRE THAT'S TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE IS ALSO TOUCHING THE BULB CASING
I THINK THAT ELECTRICITY TRAVELS IN WIRES
I THINK THAT THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT ANYMORE
IT PROVIDES ENERGY TO LIGHT THE BULB
THEY LIGHT AND THEY USE ELECTRICITY
THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK DOWN TO THE TO THE BATTERY AND IT KEEPS GOING AND MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND GOES INTO THE D CELL
THIS THESE ARE WIRES
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE IT GIVES ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE +UH+ IT’S DIFFERENT IT’S THE SAME SIDES AND THEY JUST LOVE EACH OTHER
THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING
SOME ALL THE MAGNETS ARE ON PENCILS AND SOME ATTRACT AND SOME REPEL SO THEY’RE FLOATING
BOTH OF THE MAGNETS THE SIDES ARE DIFFERENT LIKE A NORTH AND SOUTH OR SOUTH AND NORTH
I’M DOING FINE HOW ABOUT YOU <LAUGH>
THE NORTH POLE STICKS TO WHEN NORTH MAGNET STICK TO THE NORTH POLE SO IT ALWAYS POINTS TO
WHEN IT’S NORTH AND SOUTH THEY ATTRACT FOR WHEN IT’S NORTH AND NORTH OR SOUTH AND SOUTH THEY REPEL
LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND COMPASSES +WOWO+
THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING AND YEAH
IT IS A COMPASS AND THERE IS A NORTH AND THE SOUTH SAME AND NORTH AND NORTH POLE AND THE SOUTH POLE
THIS GIRL IS WANTING TO WALK NORTH SO SHE IS USING A COMPASS
THE SAME SIDES ARE TOUCHING
I THINK THAT THEY WILL REPEL EACH OTHER
THE REFRIGERATOR IS MAGNETIC
THE NAIL IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL BUT WOODBLOCK ISN’T
IT IS MADE OF IRON MAYBE NOT
<SILENCE>
THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING ON TO THE REFRIGERATOR
THE ONE MADE OF STEEL IS MADE OF IT STICKS
THEY BOTH ARE MADE OF IRON OR STEEL RIGHT DON’T YOU THINK SO
ONLY- ONLY OBJECTS THAT ARE MADE FROM IRON AND STEEL CAN STICK TO MAGNETS
AND IT ATTRACTS THINGS OBVIOUSLY WITH NORTH AND SOUTH
IS STICKS
I THINK IT IS ATTRACTED TO MAGNET BECAUSE IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
WOOD YARN PLASTIC YEAH
MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL THAT IS WHAT I LEARNED TODAY
STEEL ONE THE STEEL NAIL
THE WOODBLOCK IS DOESN’T HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL IN IT SO IT DOESN’T ATTRACT
IT WILL STAY ON THE MAGNET
I TOLD YOU IRON MAGNETS STICK TO IRON OR STEEL
MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON OR STEEL ITEMS
I NOTICED THAT IS STICKS TO THE MAGNET
WE’VE BEEN DOING STUFF LIKE CIRCUITS AND MAGNETS
ATTRACTS TWO MAGNETS ARE EITHER MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
THE MAGNETS ONLY- THE MAGNET ONLY STICKS TO THE STEEL NAIL THE PAPERCLIP THE FASTENER AND THE BLACK ROCK
ONE IS MADE OF IRON AND ONE IS STEEL AND ONE IS NOT
BECAUSE IT IS MAGNETIC THE MAGNET IS MAGNETIC AND THE NAIL IS METAL THEY’RE MADE OF IRON AND THEY’RE BOTH MADE OF IRON AND THEN THEY BOTH ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER
I FOUND OUT THAT MAGNETS STICK TO STUFF
IT WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET
WITH YOU- THEY ARE BOTH MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
IT MAY HAVE IRON OR STEEL
THE NAIL THING IS STICKING ON TO THE MAGNET
I’M GOOD HOW ARE YOU MY BEAUTIFUL <NOISE> LADY
THE WOODBLOCK DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON AND STEEL IN IT SO IT WON’T STICK TO THE MAGNET
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL BUT THE CONDUCTORS ARE
THERE IS A NAIL AND THE THERE ARE TWO WIRES THERE IS A NAIL A BATTERY AND A WIRE
BYE
I WOULD SAY IT IS CLOSED I WOULD SAY IT IS OPEN
THE NAIL
WE BUILT CIRCUITS AND WE USE SOLAR PANELS TO TRY TO MAKE A MOTOR RUN
OKAY
THE POPSICLE STICK IS THERE AND IS NOT METAL SO THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING
CONDUCTORS ARE ALWAYS METAL
THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
I THINK IT’S BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL
THE INSULATOR IS AN INSULATOR IS A THING THAT CAN’T CONDUCT ELECTRICITY LIKE A POPSICLE STICK THAT IS WOOD
INSULATORS CANNOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY AND THEY ARE NOT METAL NEED TO BE A METAL
THE MOTOR STOPS
THESE OBJECTS ARE METAL
THERE IS A WIRE A SWITCH A NAIL A MOTOR AND A BATTERY
WE’VE BEEN WORKING WITH CIRCUITS AND BATTERIES AND SOLAR PANELS
IT IS CLOSED
THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL AND THEY DON’T WILL NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
THE MOTOR IT KEEPS SPINNING WHEN THE PAPERCLIP <INDISCERNIBLE> THE OPEN SWITCH
BUT HOW ARE YOU ALL THE BEAUTIFUL LADY IN THE WORLD
A CIRCUIT IS SOMETHING <LAUGH> A CIRCUIT IT SOMETHING-
+SSSS+ THE WIRES MAKE A PATHWAY FROM THE IN THE CIRCUIT THE WIRES MAKE A PATHWAY FROM THE D-CELL TO THE BULB
WE’VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE D-CELL AND THEN THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT TO THE FIRST LIGHTBULB AND IT WILL GO BACK TO THE WIRES AND THEN INTO THE SECOND LIGHTBULB AND GOES TO THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE D-CELL
I THINK THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND THE BLUE DOTS ARE LIKE ELECTRICITY AND THEY FLOW THROUGH EVERYTHING
THINK- I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET DIMMER AND WILL NEED MORE WIRES
I SEE THAT-
I AM DONE
THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES THE D-CELL AND THE LIGHTBULB
+UM+ THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING AND IT IS CLOSED
THE D-CELL HAS STORED ENERGY THAT CAN LIGHT THE BULB AND THE WIRES TRANSFERS TRANSFER THE ENERGY TO THE BULB
I THINK THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET BRIGHTER +TA TA TA TA+
BLUE DOT- THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRICITY IT’S HOW THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS EVERYWHERE +DUN DUN+
THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW AND IT CAN’T STOP
THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW INTO THE POSITIVE AND IN OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE AND THEN +DUN DUN + HERE COME THE BEAUTIFUL LADY
ELECTRICITY FLOWS IN A CIRCUIT
ELECTRICITY ISN’T FLOWING BECAUSE THERE IN ONE BULB THE WIRE IS GOING FROM THE BULB CASING TO THE BULB BASE NO NO NO BECAUSE THE POSITIVE SIDES ARE TOGETHER
NO THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GET BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
IN TWO D-CELLS ONE LIGHTBULB RUNS OUT OF LIGHT- BURNS OUT REALLY QUICKLY BUT WITH ONE D-CELL THEY DON’T
THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY GOES TO BULB
THE LIGHTS GOT BRIGHTER
ONE OF <INDISCERNIBLE>
I NOTICE THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN I KNOW THAT THE MOTOR IS SPINNING
THE THE SOLAR CELL IS GETTING THE SUNS ENERGY AND THEN IT GETS TO AND IT GETS INTO THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR RUNS
THE MOTOR USES ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY
I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING WHEN THE SUN IS OUT
I NOTICE THAT WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING
I THINK THAT THE I DON'T THINK ANYTHING (())
IT MEANS THAT THE FLAG
THE CIRCUIT IN THIS PICTURE IS CLOSED IS OPEN BECAUSE THE NOT EVERYTHING IS NOT NOT EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED
YOU TOO
THE SWITCH IS DOWN
I NOTICE THAT THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED
THE THE D CELL BATTERY AND THE WIRES
IT MEANS THAT THE THAT THE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING
THAT MAKES THE MOTOR SPIN
THE THE CIRCUIT HAS TO BE CLOSED
THE THE SWITCH GOES DOWN AND THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY
UM WHEN I CLICK ON THE SUN THE THE THE MOTOR RUNS BUT WHEN I CLICK ON IT AGAIN
THE THE BATTERY IS HELPING THE MOTOR SPIN
WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE THE ELECTRICITY DOES NOT FLOW SO THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE UM HAS TO HAVE LIGHT
A SOLAR CELL DOES NOT GET ENERGY FROM THE SUN BECAUSE IT'S BLOCKED SO THE MOTOR WILL NOT RUN
I THINK THE SOLAR CELL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY ON A CLOUDY DAY
I THINK THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE IT IS A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE ENERGY CAN FLOW
I DON'T KNOW
THE SOLAR PANEL HAS GETS LIGHT SO AND THE LIGHT IS THE ENERGY SO THEN IT CONNECTS IT TO THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR RUNS
GOOD
THAT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR RECEIVES ENERGY AND IT SPINS
I THINK THAT THE THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED SO THAT THE THE THE MOTOR CAN RUN
THE THE MOTOR MUST HAVE A BATTERY AND TWO IT MUST HAVE A BATTERY AND TWO WIRES
THERE IS THE THE MOTOR AND THE BATTERY ARE CONNECTED TO A SWITCH AND WHEN THE SWITCH IS UP THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN BUT IF THE SWITCH IS DOWN THEN THE MOTOR DOES
I THINK THAT THE D CELL I THINK THAT THE ENERGY IS IS SPINNING
THE ELECTRICAL FLOW STOPS WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN
THE BATTERY THE BATTERY GIVES ENERGY TO THE MOTOR AND THEN AND THEN THE ENERGY GOES BACK I GUESS
SWITCH IN THIS PICTURE IS UP AND
WHEN THE SUN IS OUT THE MOTOR THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING
THIS PICTURE IS SHOWING THAT THE THE BATTERY THE BATTERY CONNECTS TO A WIRE AND IT GOES TO THE MOTOR AND THEN THE MOTOR ALSO HAS A WIRE THAT GOES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THEN THE THE BATTERY GIVES ENERGY ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING
I THINK THAT THE SOLAR CELL WILL NOT GET ANY ENERGY BECAUSE THE SUN WILL NOT GET TO THE SOLAR CELL BECAUSE THE CLOUDS ARE BLOCKING
I DON'T KNOW
THEY GET THE SUNS RAY AND THEN THEY THEY THEY THE SUN IS THE ENERGY AND THEN IT TRANSPORTS IT TO THE MOTOR
THE THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS DOWN
THERE ISN’T ENOUGH POWER IN IT
WHAT
IT PUSH IT PUSHES AROUND
I’VE BEEN- WE’VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS
WHEN THERE IS A LOTS OF WAY ON THE B SIDE THE END MOVES APART
THERE ARE WASHERS NO THEY ARE MAGNETS
I DO NOT KNOW
WASHERS GOING TO THE B CUP
THEY'RE SEPARATING
YOU CAN PUT SPACES
PUT SPACER
IT MOVES THE MAGNET FOR IT’S A WEAKER
THE <NOISE> +BREATH+ WAS LESS (*)
THERE IS A MAGNETIC FORCE
IT MAKES THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER
WE- WE SAW HOW MANY MAGNETS IT TAKES TO BREAK THE FORCE OF THE TWO MAGNETS STICKING TOGETHER
I DO NOT KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
IT BECOMES LESS AND LESS
IT WEAKENS THE FORCE
IT BECOMES LESS AND LESS
I AM DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
THE MAGNET IS MOVING THE PAPERCLIP THROUGH THE PAPER
IT'S STICKS
FRIDGES I THINK ARE MADE OUT A MAGNETS I MEAN MADE OUT METAL LIKE THINGS NO IT'S MADE AS STEEL OR IRON
WELL AT SOMETIMES DIFFERENT METALS WOULDN’T STICK TO MAGNETS SO THAT'S PROBABLY WHY IS SO WHY NAIL IS IN STICK
WELL I GET STICK TO NAIL OR IRON IN SOMETIMES EVEN ROCKS BUT I THINK THOSE ARE MADE OUT OF IRON IN STEEL SO YEAH
MESSING WITH MAGNETS
IT'S MADE OUT OF- IT’S PRI- PRI HAS LIKE METAL IN THE OUTSIDE BUT STEEL ARE LIKE IRON IN INSIDE
WELL STEEL
WELL THING LIKE THE MATERIAL LIKE IT'S STICK TO THE MAGNET IS STEEL IRON AND POSSIBLY METAL
BECAUSE THE WHITE ONE IS IN MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
REFRIGERATE DOES THE REFRIGERATORS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL OR EITHER METAL
WELL IT'S STICK TO IRON STEEL AND METAL IF IT HAS STEEL OR IRON IN IT
THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET IS BECAUSE IT'S A MADE OF STEEL OR IRON OR EVEN OR POSSIBLY METAL THAT THE REASON IS IN IS NOT STICKING TO WOOD IS BECAUSE WOOD IS A MADE AS STEEL OR IRON OR METAL IT'S THE WOOD BLOCK IS MADE <INDISCERNIBLE>
WELL SOME REFRIGERATORS I THINK ARE MADE OUT OF STEEL SO AND THE NAIL IS MADE OF STEEL
MORE ATTRACTING AS JUST LIKE STICKING BUT EXCEPT DO YOU ONLY THING A STICKS TO IS LIKE IRON STEEL AND THE AND OTHER METAL PIECES
THAT SOMETIMES THEY CAN REPEL AND ATTRACT AND SOMETIMES LIKE IT'S STICK TO REFRIGERATORS
<NO_SIGNAL>
WELL THE METAL HAS STUFF LIKE STEEL OR LIKE +AH+ IRON IN IT IN ORDER TO STICK
WOOD PLASTIC YARN BRICKS CEMENT AND I DON’T KNOW IF THAT IS BUT THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK UP
BECAUSE THE WOOD BLOCK IS MADE OUT WOOD IN THIS STEEL NAIL WAS A IS <INDISCERNIBLE>
WELL THE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL WAS I MEAN YEAH STEEL OR IRON BUT THE WOOD ISN’T MADE OF ANY OF THOSE NOT EVEN METAL
THEY ARE BOTH MADE OF STEEL
STEEL OR IRON MARNIE
THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE
THE IRON OR STEEL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET
IT WILL STICK TO IT BUT IF YOU HAVE A <INDISCERNIBLE> TO ANOTHER CHAIR THAT’S FAR ENOUGH AND YOU HAVE A STRONG MAGNET THEN IT WILL FALL FROM THERE
WELL WE HAVE BEEN MESSING WITH SOME MAGNETS AND PAPER BAGS OUTSIDE TO SEE IF THEIR WORK IF WE FOUND LITTLE PRODUCTS IN GRASS THEN THEY WANT TO GET STUCK TO THE MAGNET
THE MAGNETS PICKING UP THE STEEL NAIL BUT NOT THE IRON NAIL BECAUSE IT'S REPELLING THING
THE IRON OR STEEL FOR THE LAST TIME
UM FIVE AND THIS IS TEN FIVE GRAMS AND THIS EQUALS TEN GRAMS OR FI TWO FIVE GRAMS AND TWENTY EQUALS THIS IS MORE LIKE MATH BUT TWENTY EQUALS TWO TENS EQUALS FIVE EQUALS FOUR FIVES EQUALS TWENTY ONES
UM PAPER CLI- UM ONE SIDE WAS UM
AND WE DID WEIGH IT WITH PAPER CLIPS
I WOULD MEASURE IT WITH THESE THINGS WELL WE WOULD FIRST PUT THE ORANGE IN THE CUP <BREATH> AND THEN WE WOULD DROP ONE OF THOSE THINGS IN AND S A WE WOULD KEEP ON DROPPING THOSE THINGS IN AND SEE WELL ANY OF THOSE THINGS LIKE IF WE FIRST DROPPED A TWENTY AND IT WAS AND IT WEIGHED TOO MUCH THEN WE WOULD TAKE IT OUT AND TRY DROPPING A TEN AND IF THAT WEIGHED TOO MUCH THEN WE WOULD TRY DROPPING A FIVE AND AND IF THAT WEIGHED THE RIGHT AMOUNT THEN IT WOULD BE EQUALLY TO SIDE
MMM EACH SIDE WOULD WEIGH THE SAME AND IT WOULD <FP> BE ONE LINE
UM <FP> LIKE HAVING IT ON THERE
A GRAM'S ABOUT AS MUCH AS A PAPER CLIP
UM TWENTY GRAMS
OKAY BUT I WANNA SEE THE INTERACTIVE CHIPS
UM THREE ACTUALLY THIRTY FIVE
ACTUALLY I WEIGHED IT WITH MY TABLE WEIGHED IT WITH JUMBO PAPER CLIPS SOME OTHER ONES WEIGHED IT WITH REGULAR SA SOME OTHER TABLES WEIGHED IT WITH *REGULAR* SIZED PAPER CLIPS <BREATH> OKAY UM
WE WE CAN ADD MORE OF THAT STUFF
A HUNDRED
ALL OF THOSE THINGS WENT IN AND THE ORANGE WEIGHED MORE
ONE SIDE WAS THE
TH THE TH THE THING THE YEAH
UM MMM LET'S SEE
<BREATH> ONE EQUALS ONE GRAM FIVE WHAT'S A FIVE FIVE GRAMS IT'S A FIVE GRAM
OKAY
MILLIGRAM WEIGHS AS MUCH AS I DON'T KNOW MAYBE A GRAIN OF SUGAR OR A GRAIN OF SALT MAYBE I DON'T KNOW I DON'T REALLY I'M NOT SURE BUT <BREATH>
UM TEN HEY HI HI HI HI TRY TO GET THAT THING UM UM <BREATH> WHAT WAS SURPRISING
DIFFERENT MASSES I WANNA SEE THE DIFFERENT MASSES <BREATH>
MMM YEAH THOUSANDS
YEAH LET'S SEE <BREATH> I WANNA SEE THE TIPS I WANNA S LOOK AT THE TIPS WHAT DOES I MEAN
YEAH AND BY THE WAY WAY <LAUGH> MA MY LITTLE BROTHER ONE TIME ACTUALLY MY LITTLE BRO BROTHER'S FRIEND WHEN HE WAS AT PRESCHOOL NOW HE'S IN KINDERGARTEN BUT <BREATH> WHEN HE WAS AT PRESCHOOL UM UM I THINK THERE'S <BREATH> H S HE SUDDENLY STARTED TO HE JUST OUT OF NOWHERE S SUDDENLY WELL <FP> MA MY LITTLE BROTHER STARTED TALKING ABOUT <BREATH> SOMETHING CALLED A SIXTY TWO *MILLIGRAMS* BUT IT WAS REALLY <FP> AND IT WAS A MONS- ER NO IT WAS A KIND OF MONSTER AND HE SAID THAT HIS FRIEND MADE HIM UP <BREATH> AND THE AND <FP> AND I PR- AND I THINK THAT IT SAID ON THE ON THE IT WAS ON A S I DO IT WAS ON SOME KIND OF MONSTER <BREATH> CEREAL LIKE MONSTER KIND SOME KIND OF MONSTER CEREAL AND IT AND IT SAID SIXTY TWO MILLIGRAMS OF SOMETHING
YEAH
MMM YOU COULD HOLD IT STEADY THERE NO NO OH <BREATH> UM
UM WE WOULD ADD ONE HUNDRED IF IT WASN'T ENOUGH
JUST WEIGHS AS MUCH I MEAN
I ACTUALLY LEARNED THAT FROM MOTHER AND FATHER BECAUSE I DIDN'T LEARN ANY <BREATH> TH UH I HAVEN'T LEARNED THAT THAT MUCH ABOUT GRAMS FROM MY TEACHER BECAUSE WELL WE
<BREATH> AND ALSO I LIKE X AND I'VE ALSO HEARD EXOGRAMS MY MOTHER AND FATHER <BREATH> TOLD ME ABOUT THAT AND ALSO
UM YOU S THE BALANCE WOULD BE STRAIGHT IT WOULDN'T BE SORTA SLANTED
UM THAT THE NET ONE OF THE BEANS EQUALS A GRAM
SMALLER
NO WE NO SHE JU NO THE TEACHER JUST SHE HELD UP A LITTLE THING AND SAID THIS IS THIS IS A GRAM IS WHAT YOU USE TO DO WEIGHT THIS IS THIS IS ABOUT EQUAL IN WEIGHT TO A GRAM AND BUT THEN WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MORE TIME
THAT THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS THERE
NO
UM OKAY UH <BREATH> UM I'VE
I'VE BEEN WELL I DIDN'T KNOW I THINK BUT ON FRIDAY WE WE JUST HEARD ABOUT A GRAM WE JUST HEARD ABOUT A GRAM LIKE ON FRIDAY
A HUNDRED <LAUGH> GRAMS ONE THOUSAND
UM A <FP> <BREATH> A GRAM IS JUST ABOUT AS MUCH AS A PAPER CLIP
YEAH <BREATH>
AND BUT HE THOUGHT IT WAS SIXTY TWO *MILLIGRAMS* AND HE THOUGHT THAT IT IT WAS MONSTER
IT WAS THE INTERACTIVE TIPS
OKAY
A THOUSAND
A HUNDRED BEANS EQUALS
MILLIGRAM IS A S THOUSANDTH OF A GRAM WITH A THOUSANDTH OF A GRAM
A HUNDRED
WE HAD TO MORE LIKE THAT ONE
I WANNA LOOK AT MORE OF THAT STUFF I WANNA SEE W WAIT OH OH YEAH A HUN TEN OF THOSE EQUALS ONE O THE LITERS
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A STANDARD
NO
UM WE CAME UP WITH USING THE LITER OR THE METER OR THE GRAM
THAT <BREATH> THE ONLY THING THAT WE WE AGAIN I FORGOT AGAIN WHERE WE WERE <LAUGH>
<BREATH> UM UM M MY GROUP GOT TEN AND A HALF ANOTHER GROUP GOT TWO ANO- ANOTHER GROUP GOT TEN AND A HALF AND ANOTHER GROUP GOT TWO <LAUGH> THERE WAS SOME VIALS THIS BIG AND SOME VIALS WERE THAT BIG
NO NO NEITHER WE HAVEN'T DONE IT YET
OH THOSE THINGS PUSH OUT THE WATER AND IT'S WHEREVER THIS LITTLE POINT IS THAT'S HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THERE
WELL THAT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH WATER IT IS
<BREATH> UM A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
MMM WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU SAY WHAT WERE YOU THINKING WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
BEFORE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE SORRY <FP> GR- NO NOT THAT ONE W DID WE DO THIS ONE
<BREATH> WHA- WHAT'S ONE MILLILITER SPOO- WE DID THAT ONE AL WE ONE MILLILITER SPOON I'M WAIT I NEED TO LOOK AT THE OH YEAH WE ALREADY DIDN'T MISS THAT
UM PROB PROBABLY MILLILITERS
A MILLIGRAM NO A NO NO NO NOT A MILLIGR- GRAM A CENTIGRAM IF THERE WAS EVER SUCH A THING AS THAT <BREATH> A HUNDREDTH OF A GRAM
HEY I THINK THIS IS ON BACKWARDS THAT'S WHY IT'S KEEPS ON FALLING OFF
YEAH THAT'S
A HUNDRED
WHAT
THAT LIKE IN THE I'M TH THE THING ABOUT <BREATH>
OH BUT I WANNA SEE THE FIRST I WANNA DON'T FORGET THE A
ONE MILLILITER PROBABLY EQUALS A MILLILI- A MILLIMETER
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN BUT I WANNA SEE THE UM THAT MEANS A HUNDRED OF THOSE EQUALS ONE OF THOSE <BREATH> THOSE ARE LI MILLILITERS I THINK
YOU COULD MEASURE OUT SOMETHING THAT'S EQUAL TO A HUNDRED MILLILITERS HMM <BREATH> OH I GET IT SO LOW NOISES ARE RED ONE MILLILITERS A MILLILITER IS A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER
UM LET'S SEE H W HAVE W LET'S SEE ONE WHAT'S OH YEAH WE DID THAT ONE I THINK <LAUGH> YEAH UM A HUNDRED OF THOSE EQUALS ONE OF THOSE
HEY CAN YOU MAKE THIS BIGGER I THINK YOU I CAN
YEAH YOU COULD LOSE THOSE THINGS OOPS
OR DEPTH
A LOT OF WATER <LAUGH>
I'M NOT I I KNOW IT NOT EXACTLY LIKE THAT HEY WAS THAT THE NEXT ONE DOWN I CAN WHAT IS THAT ONE
UM A L A LITTLE CUP WHICH WAS EQUAL TO ONE LITER AND A
OVER
UM WITH MILLILITERS AND ALSO THESE THINGS <BREATH> UM THOSE ARE EACH OF THOSE IS A HUNDRED MILLILITERS
I KNOW BUT WHAT'S F NUMBER FOUR IT SAID IT WAS
MMM WHAT'S UNIT <FP> YEAH UM PROBABLY EITHER THE ONE OF THOSE TWO
MASS THE LENGTH OR WIDTH OR HEIGHT
IT'S WITH LIKE UH <BREATH> IT'S IT'S WITH LIKE LITERS WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT QUARTS OR GALLONS YET BUT WE PROBABLY WILL SOMETIME I ALREADY KN- UH WHAT IS THIS DURATION OF W OH LITERS ARE LIKE THE METRIC UM VOLUME MEASURING THING BUT BUT WHAT IS BUT BUT WHAT IS ESTERAT- GATION FOR IS IT WATTS OR SOMETHING NO ES EN INVESTIGATION
UM A HUNDRED
WHAT WHAT WHAT I W UM THE PROBABLY THE HUNDREDS
A LOT MEDIUM LOT <BREATH> THERE'S SUCH THING AS A KILOLITER I THINK
YEAH NO ACTUALLY WE DIDN'T
YEAH IT'S NOT JUST IT'S THE HEIGHT WITH DEPTH AND HEIGHT AND LENGTH HEIGHT WITH DEBT AND LENGTH
I'LL GET IT
WAIT WHAT WHAT WERE WE TA
<FP> IT'S SO FOUR VIALS EQUALS ONE OF THOSE CUPS IT THINKS <LAUGH> AND THE NINE VIALS EQUALS ONE OF THOSE <LAUGH> NINE OF THOSE THOSE THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A STANDARD
LIQUIDS THE V VOLUME OF THINGS
OKAY BUT CAN BUT CAN YOU GO CAN YOU CLICK ON THAT WHAT WAS THE WEIGHT OF A LITER <BREATH> A LITER IS WEIGHS THE SAME AMOUNT AS A KILOGRAM WOW YEAH
TH <BREATH> UM PROBABLY THE EITHER THE THIS ONE OR THOSE
OKAY HEY IT'S GOING IT'S GOING IT'S DOING IT IT'S DOING IT SED- <BREATH> HMM
THAT WE SORT OF DID
MMM WHA- THE <FP> WHAT'D YOU SAY <LAUGH> PAYING ATTENTION I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS THING
LITERS NOW CAN WE LOOK AT THIS
WE USED I FORGOT WHAT THEY WERE CALLED THOSE LITTLE THINGS WHERE YOU SOMETIMES KEEP FOIL MAYBE THEY MIGHT THEY MIGHT'VE BEEN THOSE THINGS OR YOU KEEP <FP> THOSE <FP> YOUR MEMORY THOSE LITTLE MEMORY PER THINGS NO STARTED WITH A V I CAN'T REMEMBER VIAL VIAL <BREATH> WELL THE TEACHER *ACCIDENTALLY* SNUCK IN S THAT W SOME OF THEM WERE A LOT SMALLER THAN THE OTHER MADE SOME OF THEM SMALLER THAN THE OTHERS
WAIT
UM YOU WOULD FIND THE CUP THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT AND YOU WOULD POUR IT IN <BREATH> YEAH
OH YEAH THOSE
WE HAVEN'T USED WITH THOSE THINGS YET <FP> THE TEACHER HAS ONLY SHOWN US WE DID THE VIAL THING AND THEN THE TEACHER <FP> ALSO SHOWED US BUT
ANY LIQUID
WELL LIKE WELL UM BECAUSE THEN SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S THIS AMOUNT W OF VIALS AND SOME PEOPLE SAY IT'S TH A DIFFERENT AMOUNT
NO LET'S S COMPARE VIALS YEAH <LAUGH> THAT'S LIKE WHAT OURS WERE
YEAH
A TENTH
OOPS
WHAT OH TEN
YEAH
UM YOU COULD S MEASURE OUT
THE WEIGHT
NO NO NO A GRAM
IT'S A HUNDREDTH
NO THOUSAND
UM S THOUSANDTH
UM THE VOLUME IT'S THE AMOUNT OF IT THE AMOUNT OF THE STUFF
OH A HUNDRED YEAH A GRAM IS EQUAL TO A HUNDRED OF THOSE
LE LE I WANNA DO GRADUATED C
YEAH THEN IF IT WAS MORE AND YOU DIDN'T YOU HAD SAY ONE HUNDRED AND IF IT WAS MORE THAN THAT YOU WOULD POUR IT IN AND GET AND YOU WOULD SAY TWO HUNDRED AND THEN YOU F <FP> AND THEN IF THERE WAS STILL MORE YOU WOULD POUR IT IN AGAIN AND SAY F WHERE WAS I THREE HUNDRED AND THEN IF YOU ADD ANOTHER <BREATH> IT WOULD FIVE HUNDRED CAUSE SIX HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED <BREATH> A THOUSAND ET CETERA ET CETERA ACTUALLY ONE LITER WOULD BE A THOUSAND <LAUGH>
MMM THAT'S A HUNDRED THAT'S A THOUSANDTH OF IT THAT'S A TENTH AND THAT'S TENTH OF IT AND THAT'S A WHOLE OF IT
MMM WELL WE TOOK A OUR S SOCIAL STUDIES AND SCIENCE JOURNAL THING AND WE STARTED WRITING ONE METER EQUALS <FP> NO ACTUALLY WE DIDN'T DO THAT MMM
NO THE IT <FP> UH IT ISN'T COLORED AT ALL
THOSE THINGS MARKS CENTIMETERS OKAY
UM WELL
NO OH YEAH WE DID WE WE DID
<FP> <FP> WE LEARNED ABOUT MEASUREMENT THE METRIC SYSTEM UH <FP> UM
MMM READING WRITING AND MATH MAINLY
MMM HMM MMM HMM WELL OKAY
WHAT A SCALE ONE MILLIMETER <BREATH>
YEAH PROBABLY
NO
YEAH YOU MIGHT COLOR IT THOUGH I I HAVE NO IDEA WE MIGHT COLOR IT SOMETIME
NO
YEAH I WAS BLOWING ON MINE A BIT <BREATH>
NOPE NOT AT ALL
OKAY
UM MY FAVORITE ANIMAL IS A BLACK DRAGON FISH AND I REALLY LIKE THE OCEAN BECAUSE A BLACK DRAGON *FISH* IS A KIND OF FISH THAT LIVES IN THE OCEAN AND IT'S A DEEP SEA S FISH LIKE ESPECIALLY LIKE DEEP SEA FISH
OKAY
TEN ARE IN ONE TEN MILLIMETERS ARE IN ONE CENTIMETER
NO WE JUST START WE JUST STARTED CUTTING IT OUT AND GLUED IT TOGETHER
WHOOPS AWW
A CENTIMETER IS A HUNDREDTH OF A METER IT IS A HUNDRED AND ONE METER GOING ALL THE WAY
MAYBE
NO WE ALREADY HAD RULERS BUT WE DIDN'T USE THEM WE LEARNED ABOUT THE METRIC WITH METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND ALL THE OTH- AND THE REST OF THE WORLD USES
A MILLIMETER
MMM OH YEAH WE MEASURED OUR DESK WITH STRAWS
<BREATH> I WANNA SEE WHAT ELSE IS THERE I DON'T WANNA GET
OH WELL
OKAY
BECAUSE MY DESK SEEMED SHORTER THAN ALL THE OTHER ONES AT MY TABLE
UM A METER IS THREE POINT SOMETHING FEET
ONE TEN MILLIMETER EQUALS ONE TEENY CENTIMETER <BREATH>
OKAY <FP> <FP> OH THIS IS RED
BY TO IT BECAUSE <BREATH> LIKE MOST PEOPLE DESKS WERE THREE BY TWO BUT MINE WAS TWO AND NINE TENTHS BY TWO
UM MY DESK WAS WAS I THINK IT WAS TWO AND LIKE TWO AND NINE TENTHS THAT W <BREATH> UM WHAT WAS IT CALLED AGAIN LONG TWO AND TENTHS LONG THAT WAY <BREATH> AND IN T IN A GROUND I'D SAY ABOUT TWO WIDE
MMM HMM OKAY
HI LOOK <LAUGH> THAT THING IS GOING LOOK THAT THING GOES
BY TO YEAH BECAUSE TO BE A NINE TENTH IS AL I MEAN TWO AND NINE TENTHS IS ALMOST THREE
THAT'S WHA- THE RED LINE IS ONE CENTIMETER ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN OF THOSE
RIGHT THERE
UM IT'S A METER TAPE AND YOU WRITE YOUR NAME THERE
UH-HUH BUT I WANNA VIDEOTAPE MY TONSILS
WELL BECAUSE THAT'S ONE'S WIDE <BREATH> IT'S TOO FLAT AND THOSE TWO OUT IT WOULD BE THE SAME SIZE AS THAT
MMM NO NO WE HAVE ONE CUP AND IT HAS AN A LINE A B LINE A C LINE A D LINE
YEAH WE USED THAT THING
YEAH
WHAT WAS THE SODA CAN THE INTERACTIVE SODA CAN I LIKE THE INTERACTIVE ONES AW
MAYBE THAT'S A WAIT BUT THERE'S SOMETHING A BIT IN INACCURATE THERE THEY THE IT ISN'T <BREATH> EXACTLY BECAUSE LOOK SEE THAT THING'S THE SAME AMOUNT WIDE AS THAT OH IT MIGHT BE L LONGER THAT WAY
WELL WE DID THE WELL WE A WELL M WELL NOT REALLY SORT OF WE MEASURED AND MADE SURE THAT BUT THE THIS MY GROUP WE GOT ONE OF THOSE BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS IT WASN'T A HUNDRED MILLILITER IT WAS A FIFTY MILLILITER ONE
UM HOW MANY <FP> OH THAT'S A THOUSAND IN THAT BIG THING IN ONE LITER
UM UM <FP> HMM NOT REALLY
SYRINGES YES YOU JUST TA I JU HEY I JUST SAW A SYRINGE I JUST SAW FIFTY AND WE ALSO LEWS- USED FIFTY MILLILITER ONES
YEAH MMM WELL NOT WELL SORT OF THAT'S SORT OF LIKE WHAT WE DID LAST TIME
WELL M L *STANDS* STANDS FOR MILLILITERS AND THEN THE NUMBER IN FRONT OF IT THAT'S HOW MANY MILLILITERS IT IS
WELL BY THOSE THINGS ON THE
YEAH THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO THAT WAS BEFORE WINTER BREAK
THAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS BUT WHAT WHAT IS IT CALLED IS WHAT I'M WONDERING OH A TRAY
WAIT HOW IS THAT PO POS I WANNA LOOK AT THAT AGAIN I FORGOT HOW HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE OH YEAH COUNTING THE TOP IT WAS POSSIBLE
TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER GRADUATED CYLINDERS EQUAL WHAT'S THAT
YEAH
<BREATH> THE LAST THING THAT WE DID WITH WHAT WE ME WE USED TH THOSE VIALS WE USED THOSE VIALS AND WE MEASURED THE AMOUNT OF WATER IN SOME CUPS IN THESE CUPS AND THEY HAD LU THESE MARKINGS ON THEM THEY HAD THESE
YEAH WITH NO
THEN FOR THOSE YOU JUST POUR IT IN FOR THOSE YOU POUR SOME YOU PUT WATER IN THOSE
IT'S THE ONLY INTERACTIVE ONE
AND WE WEREN'T USING VIALS WE L USED VIALS A LONG TIME AGO
NO BUT WHOA A HUNDRED MILLILI- THAT LOOKS NE EQUALS
BECAUSE THE VIALS WERE DIFFERENT YEAH S MILLILITERS
MILLILITERS ARE UM ARE THOUSANDTHS OF A LITER THEY'RE THOUSANDTHS OF A LITER
WE <FP> WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE WATER'S LINED UP AND THE ONE THAT THE WATER IS LINED UP TO IS THE ONE THAT YOU'RE
BUT I WANNA LOOK AT THE INT- THAT'S THE ONLY INTERACTIVE THING THOUGH
AND YOU PULL WATER OUT OF THE YOU PULL THE WATER OUT OF THE CUP AND INTO THE SYRINGE AND THEN YOU SQUIRT IT BACK IN AND THEN MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT WAS IN THE CUP WITH THE SYRINGE
TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER VESSELS OH I GET IT OH I GET IT NOW THAT'S NEAT BECAUSE THAT ONE IS REALLY TALL SO IT HAS A LOT IN IT THAT ONE'S S <FP> THAT ONE'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE ONE THAT WE HAD BEFORE OR MAYBE THAT ONE'S THE SAME SIZE BUT WHICHEVER ONE NOW THOSE ARE SO THAT THAT ONE'S REALLY F WIDE THAT ONE'S REALLY TALL THAT ONE'S IN THE MIDDLE AND THAT ONE IS SORT OF IN BETWEEN THESE TWO <BREATH> BUT THEY'RE ALL THE SAME AMOUNT
<LAUGH> IT'S INTERACTIVE OR IN SODA LOOK SEE IT SAYS ORANGE SODA
UM OH THAT ONE'S REALLY WELL THAT ONE IS THE SAME AS THAT SO THAT ONE WEIGHS THE SAME AS THAT OTHER ONE THE MIDDLE ONE THAT WE SAW BEFORE IN THAT THING AND THAT WAS TWO HUNDRED
UM WE GOT WATER OUT OF FIRST WE GOT WATER OUT OF CUP MARKED C WE GOT WATER OUT OF CUP MARKED C THERE WAS THIS CUP AND IT HAD AN A MARK A B MARK AND A D MARK AND A C MARK AND THEN WE USED THAT THING WHICH WE HAD BEFORE IT WAS THOSE THINGS WHICH YOU SUCK UP THE WATER WITH
UH THE SYRINGE IS A IS A THING THAT SORTA SUCKS UP WATER IT'S AND THEN IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH IS IN THERE THAT YOU SUCKED UP
YEAH
MILLILITERS
ONE LITER
UM <BREATH> WELL BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS EXACTLY TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
UM FIFTY MOST OF ARE GRADUATED CYLINDERS BUT THOSE ONES HAVE A HUNDRED
+UM+ I DON'T KNOW
<BREATH> YOU KNOW BECAUSE WHENEVER THE SWITCH TOUCHES THE METAL +UM+ YOU
I THINK THAT +UM+ BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB ONE FILAMENT IS BROKEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WERE NOT LIGHT
I THINK SOME FORM ISN'T LET OUT BECAUSE +UM+ THE SWITCH IS ON
WHENEVER THE +UM+ MIDDLE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THE FLOW OF THE ELECTRICITY COMPLETELY STOPS BECAUSE ALL OF THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH IT
I DON'T KNOW
GOOD
+UM+ I SEE THAT THERE ARE WIRES AND THE SWITCHES ON CONNECTED <BREATH> BUT IF YOU  CONNECT THE SWITCH SO THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT
THINK THAT ALL OF THEM ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE MAYBE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE TOGETHER
<SIDE_SPEECH> I THINK THAT EACH AND EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN WIRE OH +UM+ SO WHENEVER ONE FILAMENT BREAKS THE OTHER ONE STILL LIGHT
THE OTHER ONE IS STILL LIGHTING BECAUSE EACH LIGHT BULB HAS THEIR OWN LIGHT AND OWN WIRE
I THINK THERE WAS SERIES CIRCUIT IS LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE SWITCH AND WHENEVER I'M CLICK THE SWITCH IT TURNS ON TO MAKES THE LIGHT BULB TURNED ON
WHENEVER ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER ONE BURNS OUT <SIDE_SPEECH>
WHENEVER +UM+ ONE BULB BURNTS OUT THE OTHER ONE BULB BURNS OUT
I THINK THAT +UM+ IT WHENEVER IS THE BOTH THAT ONE BREAKS BOTH OF THEM POWER OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTED AND THEN THEY WON'T WORK IT THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED ANY MORE
WHENEVER ONE +UM+ LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WON'T WORK
<BREATH> I NOTICED THAT WHENEVER ONE FILAMENT BREAKS THE OTHER ONE WORKING BECAUSE THE OTHER WIRE IS
I THINK THAT THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED TO ONE BATTERY
+UM+ I THINK I DON'T KNOW
<SIDE_SPEECH> BYE MORNIE
<BREATH> WHENEVER I CLICK ON THE SWITCH THE SWITCH CONNECTS TO THE WIRE I MEAN TO THE METAL THINGS AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB TURNS ON BECAUSE +UM+ BECAUSE ON THE SWITCH HAS IT'S METAL SO THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH IT
I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT +UM+ HOW A MAGNETS HOW THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO MAGNETS AND THE FORCE OF MAGNET
<SILENCE> HEY I DON'T KNOW
I'VE SEEN ONE WHERE +UM+ <BREATH> ONE IS CONNECTED TO A SWITCH ONE IS HAS THEIR OWN WIRES AND ONE SHARE A WIRE
I THINK THE ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE ONE FILAMENT BREAKS IN THEIR CONNECTED SO THEY WON'T WORK ANYMORE
<BREATH> THE ELECTRICITY STOPS +UM+ THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
+UM+ THE FLOW THE ELECTRICITY STOPS WHENEVER THE FILAMENT IS BROKEN SO NONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS WERE LIGHTS
WHENEVER THE WHENEVER THE FILAMENT BREAKS AND THE OTHER ONE THE OTHER ONE IS STILL LIGHTING BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE THEIR SEPARATE THEIR OWN SEPARATE WIRE
<BREATH> WHENEVER +UM+ WHENEVER THE FILAMENT BREAKS THE OTHER LIGHT BULB SUBSLIDING BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTED
<BREATH> IT HAS TO DO THE BULB BURNING OUT BECAUSE +UM+ THE FILAMENT BREAKS AND LIKE WHENEVER A FILAMENT BREAKS SO LIGHT BULB WON'T LIKE ANYMORE
WHENEVER YOU CONNECT THE SWITCH <SIDE_SPEECH>  TO A LIGHT BULB +UM+ YOU CAN'T WHENEVER YOU CONNECT THE SWITCH TO THE METAL PIECES +UH UMM+ I DON’T KNOW
WHENEVER THE FILAMENT BREAKS THAT'S WHEN THE BOTH LIGHT BULBS STOP WORKING
I THINK REALLY IT'S THE LAST ONE I SAW BECAUSE ONE FILAMENT IS BREAKING AND THE LIGHT BULB BURNTS OUT AND THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING
I NOTICED THAT SOMETHING WHAT IS LIKE A POPSICLE STICK AND IT WON’T WORK BECAUSE IT CAN’T CREATE WOOD CAN’T CREATE THE SPARK OF ELECTRICITY
CONDUCTORS OR ANYTHING METAL THAT CAN CREATE <BREATH> CREATE IS SPARK OF ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY
I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS CLOSED MAY BE
THE MOTOR DOES NOT SPIN BECAUSE +UM+ SPONGE IS NOT METAL SO IT CAN’T CREATE SPARK OF ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY
THE NAILS IS MAKING CREATING ENERGY FROM THE SWITCH TO MAKES THE FLAGS SPIN AROUND
I’VE BEEN WORKING ON +HM+ CIRCUITS AND DIFFERENT THINGS TO MAKE THE MOTORS BEEN AROUND AND AROUND
IT’S METAL SO IT WILL WORK BUT IF I CLICK ON THE SPONGE IT WILL IT WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE THAT IS NOT METAL
HOW ARE YOU
I HAVE BEEN LEARNING THAT METAL CAN MAKES THE FLAGS SPIN BUT OTHER THIGS THAT ARE NOT METAL CAN’T
OPEN I THINK OPEN MAYBE
ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY
THE NAIL
BYE MARNIE HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME
THERE IS A D-CELL WIRES A SWITCH AND A NAIL
THE PAPER CLIPS IS METAL SO IT CREATES ENERGY INTO THE MOTOR SO YOU CAN MAKE THE FLAG SPIN
WHAT HAPPENS IS +UM+ LIKE IF YOU CLICK ON A  METAL THING LIKE A PAPERCLIP IT WILL SPIN BUT IF YOU CLICK ON SOMETHING LIKE A ROCK IT WILL NOT-
<SILENCE> CLOSED MAY BE
IF IT’S METAL AT WORK RIGHT IF IT’S NOT METAL IT WILL NOT WORK LIKE THIS ROCK IT IS NOT METAL  SO IT WILL NOT
THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING BECAUSE ENERGY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH THE WOOD
THE WOOD STICK I THINK ITS BEEN INSULATED AND ITS CANNOT CREATE ENERGY BECAUSE ITS WOOD AND WOOD CANNOT CREATE A SPARK OF ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY
YOU GET TO USE THE DIFFERENCE STUFF TO MAKE THE MOTOR
I NOTICED THAT THEY’RE ALL METAL AND NOT LIKE PLASTIC RUBBER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
THAT LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING SO WITH DOESN’T SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB CAN’T DOESN’T LIGHT LIKE AND I (*) CUTTING THE LIGHT BULBS
I NOTICE THAT WHENEVER I CLICK ON A LIGHT BULB THE FILAMENT BREAKS BUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS STILL LIGHTING
I KNOW THAT +UM+ THE CIRCUIT IS NOT THE ON THE METAL SIDE SO IT THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING
I’M I THINK THAT EVERYONE EVERY LIGHT BULB HAS ITS OWN ENERGY I MEAN WIRED SO THAT THE OTHER ONE AND IF ONE BURNS OUT THE OTHER ONE WILL STILL LIGHT
<BREATH> I AM LEARNING ABOUT MAR-
WHATEVER ONE BREAKS THE OTHER ONE IS THE LIGHTING BECAUSE IT HAS ITS OWNED WIRES
I’M NOTICED THAT WHENEVER ONE LIGHT BULB BREAKS THE OTHER ONES STILL-
WHENEVER I CLICK ON A BULB +AH+ ONE IS THE ENERGY COMPLETELY STOPS
I DON’T KNOW <NOISE> I
I DON’T NOTHING TO MARKER
PARALLEL NAIL
I HAVE EVEN
+UM+ I THINK THAT THE +AH+ ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS BURNED OUT AND THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULBS GET RIGHT BECAUSE IT WON’T THEY WORK
+UM+ I THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOKED WILL NOT LIKE LIGHTING NEW MORE
THE FILAMENT BREAK
I THINK WHAT HAPPEN WHEN BULB BREAKS IS THAT THE ELECTRICITY DOESN’T FLOWS THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
THE SWITCH TURNED TO METAL SO IT THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING BUT IF I CLICKED AGAIN THE SWITCH TURNED OFF AND IT IS NOT LIKE THE
I THINK ALL OF THE CIRCUITS ARE CONNECTED BECAUSE ALL OF THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO ONE LIGHT BULB THAT MAY BE
I’M I THINK A SERIES CIRCUIT IS LIKE THAT BECAUSE +UM+ MAY BE BECAUSE THE WIRE IS CONNECTED TO THE SWITCH AND THE ONLY WAY FOR THE LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT IS BECAUSE SO ON SWITCHED GET ON THE METAL
THIS PICTURE HAS TO DO WITH THE BULB BURNING UP BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS BURNED OUT AND THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT WORKING SO THAT MAKES SENSE
I AM DOING GOOD HOW ARE YOU
BECAUSE OF THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT DEPENDENT <NOISE> (*)
I THINK THAT ONE FILAMENT IS BROKEN AND THEN THE OTHER ONE ISNT LIGHTING BECAUSE IS THE ONE IS BROKE
I DO NOT KNOW
I THINK THE PICTURE IS THAT ONE +UM+ LIGHT- ONE FILAMENT IS BROKEN SO IT DOESN’T WORK BUT THE OTHER ONE IS WORKING BECAUSE IT HAS ITS OWN WIRE
THE ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE +UM+ THE FILAMENT BREAKS AND THE ONE FILAMENT CAN'T CONNECTS TO THE OTHER FILAMENT TO MAKE A <SIDE_SPEECH> LET ENERGY FLOWS
I THINK IT RELATES TO THE LAST ONE I STOP BECAUSE ONE +HM+ FILAMENT BREAKS AND THEN ITS STOPS LIGHTING AND THEN THEY REPLACE IT WITH THE NEW ONE AND THEN LIGHT AGAIN
ELECTRICITY COMPLETELY STOPS
ONE +AH+ LIGHT BULB IS BURNED OUT BECAUSE OF THE FILAMENT BROKE <BREATH>  SO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
I THINK THAT WHEN EVER FILAMENT BREAKS BOTH THESE ARE LIGHT BULB TURN ON JUST BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB AND HELPS TO OTHER LIGHT BULB WIRE
I THINK THEY’RE ALL CONNECTED IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THEY +UM+ EACH AT THEY EACH ALL ARE CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULB I MEAN THE BATTERY SORRY
WHAT HAPPEN WHEN ONE LIGHT BULB GOES OUT IS THE THE LIGHT BULB THAT DOESN’T WORK AND THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHTING OF WORK
A BATTERY
I AM GREAT HOW ARE YOU
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT IS THE MINUS SIGN BUT THAT’S REALLY OH I GET THINK OF RIGHT NOW WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND
THE MINUS SIGN RIGHT
IT IS FLOWING AWAY FROM THE MINUS SIDE
I THINK IT MEANS THAT AND YOU YOU PUT IT THE WIRES ON THE BATTERY AND CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULB THAT IT’S LIKE A PATHWAY FOR ENERGY INTO THE LIGHT BULB
I THINK THE LIGHT I THINK THE LIGHT BULB IS A RECEIVER BECAUSE THE D-CELL BATTERY CREATES ENERGY AND RESERVE WIRES MAKE IT FLOW THROUGH AND THEN THE LIGHT BULB RECEIVE THE ENERGY TO MAKE IT LIGHT
I NOTICED THAT NOW IT’S NOW THAT IS PUT AROUND THE ENERGY IS GOING TO THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS ALWAYS GOES OUT OF THE MINUS SIDE AND IN ALWAYS GOES INTO THE PLUS SIDE
<SIDE SPEECH>  I’M I THINK THAT IT’S GOING TOWARDS THE PLUS SIGN AND IT’S THE BLUE THINGS ARE GOING FAST IF THAT’S WOULD YOU ASKING THEM I DON’T REALLY KNOW
I THINK IT’S A SOURCE BECAUSE I’M IT’S A SOURCE TO LIKE A LIGHT BULB
BYE MARNIE THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU’RE GREAT HOPE
THEY HELP THEY HELP LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
COMPONENT NEEDS HANG ON
I THINK WHAT TRAVELS IN WIRES IS ENERGY TOOK TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
I NOTICED THAT THE BATTERY NEEDS LIKE ITS TURNED AROUND SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN GO OUT OF THE MINUS SIDE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK INTO THE PLUS SIGN
IT’S IMPORTANT TO HELP NO LIGHT BULB LIGHT BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS A REALLY BIG (*) TO USE
I SEE THAT IT’S THE ENERGY IS STARTING FROM THE D-CELL BATTERY FLOWING UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN DOWN BACK INTO THE D-CELL BATTERY TO MAKES THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT
I THINK THAT THE WIRES CARRY ENERGY MAYBE
I MEAN THAT IT HELPS THEM AND IT HELPS LIGHT A LIGHT BULB BY I’M USING ENERGY TO (*)
<SIDE SPEECH> THE LIGHT BULB IS HELPING EVERYTHING LIKE WHENEVER IT’S DARK LIKE IN A HOUSE BASICALLY
I NOTICED THAT THE LIGHT OR THE BATTERY IS TURNED AROUND SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN MOVE IT IS FROM THE LIGHT BULB BUT IF I WAS TURNED AROUND THE OTHER WAY THE ENERGY WOULD GO AROUND THE OTHER WAY
THE WIRES ARE THE WIRES I FOUND <SIDE SPEECH> I THINK THE WIRES CREATES A SPARK AND MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
THE <SIDE SPEECH> THE MINUS SIGN THE MINUS- THE MINUS SIGN IS THE NEGATIVE BECAUSE THAT HAS A MINUS SIGN TO MAKE IT GO THROUGH AND THEN THE POSITIVE SIGN IS THE PLUS SIGN SINCE SO IT MAKE A COMES THROUGH IT SO THAT IT THAT MEANS IT’S POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE THAT MEANS MINUS SIGN IS NEGATIVE AND THE PLUS SIGN IS POSITIVE MAYBE
WHITE BULBS ARE TURNED LIGHT OVER ROOM OR ANYTHING THAT NEEDS LIGHT IN DARKNESS JUST LIKE THE SUN
I THINK THAT IT WOULD IT WOULD I’M MAKE MORE ENERGY SO THAT IT WOULD SHOWED UP ONE EDGE AND GO FASTER MAYBE
I’VE BEEN LEARNING HOW DO USED STUFF TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB
THE ENERGY IS STARING FROM THE MINUS AND GOING UP INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND COMING OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE PLUS SIDE
IT BECAUSE THAT IS THE MINUS SIGN AND IT HEADS TOWARDS SO LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT COMES OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB TOWARDS THE PLUS
I THINK THE BLUE DOT REPRESENT THE ENERGY
THERE IS A LIGHT BULB WIRES AND A BATTERY
I THINK THAT MEANS +HM+ <SIDE SPEECH> WAIT CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
I NOTICE THAT IF YOU STICK AMONG THE EDGES THEY WILL WORK BUT IF YOU STICK AMONG THE BOTTOM THEY WOULD NOT WORK WHY IS THAT POSSIBLE
<SIDE_SPEECH> I THINK THE BULB IS IN THAT UP BECAUSE THE +UM+ SWITCH IS ON THE TWO METAL PIECES
GOOD
<NO_SIGNAL>
+UM+ <SIDE_SPEECH> I KNOW THAT IF THE SWITCH IS CONNECTED TO THE OTHER TWO METAL PIECES THAT THE LIGHT BULB WOULD LIGHT UP
WHENEVER I CLICK ON THE SWITCH THE SWITCH TOUCHES THE TWO METAL THINGS THEN THE LIGHT BULBS TURNS ON I THINK THAT WHENEVER THAT HAPPENS JUST BECAUSE THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE METAL TO THE SWITCH AND THEN IT'S CREATING ENERGY AND THEN THE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE SWITCH AND THEN BACK INTO THE WIRES TO MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
I THINK A PARALLEL <SIDE_SPEECH> CIRCUIT MAYBE
WHENEVER I WHENEVER I HAVE +UM+ IT STRING AWAY IT'S AND ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THE THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WON'T WORK
<NO_SIGNAL>
I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
I KNOW THAT
I KNOW THAT +UM+ STRINGS OF LIGHTS THEY <SIDE_SPEECH>
I THINK THAT THE SERIES CIRCUITS +UM+ <BREATH> I THINK IT SERIES CIRCUIT IS LIKE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE HAVE SHOW THE SAME WIRE AND THEN WHENEVER ONE LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER LIGHT BULB BURNS OUT
I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
<BREATH> THEY HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
MAGNETS CAN ATTRACTS ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL
I THINK THAT IF YOU GET A PAPER CLIP TO STICK IT WILL BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
I THINK THAT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT STICK TO THE MAGNET OR EITHER MADE OUT OF +UM+ <SIDE_SPEECH> STEEL OR IRON
THE +UM+ PAPER CLIPS STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON
I THINK THAT THE PAPER CLIP IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
THE ALUMINIUM NAIL DOESN'T STICK BECAUSE IT IS IT DOESN'T HAVE <BREATH> STEEL OR IRON IN IT BUT THE STEEL NAIL DOES HAVE STEEL OR IRON IN IT
<SIDE_SPEECH> ANYTHING METAL OR STEEL WORKS I MEAN ANYTHING METAL STEEL OR IRON WERE NOT ALL METALS DO BUT MOST METALS STEEL AND ALL STEEL AND ALL IRON WELL
THE WOOD THE +UM+ STEEL NAIL WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S IT HAS EITHER IRON OR STEEL IN IT BUT THE BLOCK WILL NOT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE IRON NOR STEEL
MAGNETS CAN STICK TO EVERYTHING THAT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL OR METAL
THIS BUNCH WON'T STICK TO MAGNET WOOD WON'T STICK TO MAGNETS ANYTHING GO LIVING WON'T STICK TO MAGNETS
<SIDE_SPEECH> I THINK THAT THE FRIDGES EITHER MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
MAGNETS CAN STICK TO ANYTHING THAT'S MADE OF METAL OR STEEL NO NO <LAUGH> +UM+ THEY CAN ALSO STICK TO IRON
<SIDE_SPEECH> +UM+ THE STEEL NAIL IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON AND THE BLOCK IS NOT STICKING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE <BREATH>  IT'S DOESN'T HAVE STEEL OR IRON
IF ORDERED FOR SOMETHING TO STICK TO A MAGNET IT HAS TO HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
I'M DOING PRETTY GOOD
MAGNETS STICK TO ANYTHING STEEL METAL WILL NOT EVERY SINGLE METAL BUT SOME METAL AND IRON
STEEL OR IRON
<SIDE_SPEECH> THERE HAS TO BE A CERTAIN TYPE OF METAL FOR IT TO STICK TO A MAGNETS
THE NAIL AND THE REFRIGERATOR WAS STICK TO A MAGNET <BREATH> BECAUSE IT EITHER HAS A METAL <SIDE_SPEECH> STEEL OR IRON IN IT
<SIDE_SPEECH> THE STEEL NAIL WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL OR IRON AND THE WOODEN BLOCK WILL NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT MADE OF THE STEEL OR IRON
THIS STEEL ONE WAS STICK BECAUSE IT HAS EITHER STEEL OR IRON IN IT
<BREATH> THE ONLY THING THAT +UM+ METAL THE ONLY THING A MAGNET CAN STICK TO METAL IS THAT THE METAL HAS TO HAVE <SIDE_SPEECH> THE METAL HAS TO HAVE STEEL OR IRON IN IT
+UM+ MORE EVER MAGNETS HAVE A MAGNETIC FORCE SO THEY CAN PICK UP ANYTHING WITH IRON IN IT
<BREATH> STEEL OR IRON
THEY HAD MADE THAT OF +UM+ STEEL OR IRON
I THINK THE SOLAR CELL WHEN IT CREATES ENERGY TO MAKES THE MOTOR MOVE SO THE FLAG WILL NOT SPIN
I THINK IS IT’S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DOESN’T WASTE ENERGY AND NO IT DOESN’T WASTE
THE SUN IS GIVING IS GIVING LIGHT TO THE SOLAR PANEL AND IT’S ON CREATING A ENERGY SO AND IT FLOWS TO THE WIRES
SUN IS GIVING THE SOLAR ENERGY AND IT’S FLOWS TO THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKES THE FLAG SPIN
ENERGY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE D-CELL INTO THE WIRES AND THE MOTOR RECEIVES IT
WHENEVER I CLICK ON THE SIGN IT MAKES LIKE TO MAKES THE FLAG SPIN BUT WHENEVER I CLICK ON THE SIGN AGAIN IT CREATES DARK CLOUDS SO THE MOTOR THE FLAG WILL NOT
ENERGY
YOU TO MARNIE THANK YOU BYE
I THINK WHENEVER IS THE SWITCH WAS OFF THEN IT CREATES SPARK BUT WHENEVER THE SWITCH IS ON THE OTHER METAL IT CREATES A SPARK TO MAKE THE FLAG MOVE
AND THE D-CELL CREATES ENERGY AND IT FLOWS TO THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKES THIS FLAG
WHENEVER SWITCH IS CLOSED I NOTICED THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING
WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE IS CREATE IT MAKING A MOTOR RUN
WHENEVER THE SUN IS OUT IT THE SUN MIGHT GOES TO THE SOLAR PANEL TO AND IT CREATES ENERGY THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE FLAG SPIN BUT IF IT IS CLOUDY IT CAN’T DO THAT STUFF LIKE I SAID
THE FLAG DOESN’T NOT MOVE
THE BATTERY HELPS LIKE CHARGING JUST LIKE A <BREATH>
THE ELECTRICAL FLOW FROM THE D-CELL BATTERY STOPS
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
I’M I THINK THAT THE D-CELL IS <BREATH> CREATING ENERGY TO MAKES THEM MOTOR MOVE AND THE WIRES ARE CAN CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR TO MAKES IT MOVE BUT THE SWITCH IS NOT TOUCHING THE OTHER WIRES SO THE MOTOR WILL NOT MOVE
ENERGY IS NOT HAPPENING IN THE
I NOTICED THAT WHENEVER I (*)  ONCE THE FLAG IT TOUCH THE METAL ON THE FLAG STARTED MOVING WHENEVER IT LIKE IT BEGAN THE FLAGS STOP MOVING WHY IS THAT
ENERGY IS GOING INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THAT FLAG SPIN
SOME LIGHT HAS TO HIT THE I’M SOLAR PANEL
THE SOLAR CELLS GET POWER FROM THE LIGHT WHENEVER IS THE SUN HITS THE CELLS IT’S CREATES ENERGY TO FLOW INTO WHEN EVER ITS FLOWING IT
NO
THE D-CELL BATTERY AND MAY CREATES THE ENERGY TO MAKES THE MOTOR MOVE
I THINK THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE ON THE METAL TO MAKES THE FLAG TO MOVE THE CREATE ENERGY
I’M A I SEE THAT THERE IS A D CELL FOUR WIRES AND THEN THE WIRES ARE +UM+ IN THE METAL THINGS TO MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
I THINK THERE’S ENERGY BECAUSE THERE’RE MORE WIRES AND MORE WIRES THINGS <SIDE_ SPEECH> BATTERY LIGHT BULBS
I NOTICED THAT THERE IS MANY PATHWAYS
<SILENCE> I DON’T KNOW
I THINK WE’VE TWO PATHWAYS-
OH I SPEAK THAT THEY TOP ONE WOULD
I THINK THAT THE TOP CIRCUIT WILL BE BECAUSE THE TOP CIRCUIT SO VERY BRIGHT
I NOTICEDTHAT THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH ALL OF THEM
I THINK THAT THERE ARE MORE PATH WAYS MAY BE
I REMEMBER THAT +AH+ A CLOSED THAT IS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN BACK INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
I OBSERVED THAT +UM+ ITS POSSIBLE GOING OTHER POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN LIKE THEY ARE LIKE +UM+ I DON’T
+UM+ I THINK THAT IT’S GOING UNDER THE NEGATIVE SIDE INTO THE BATTERY I MEAN ALL OF THE BATTERY AT THEN INTO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB IN BACK END TO THE BATTERY
I NOTICED THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE ONE LIGHT BULB IN THE LEFT AND THERE IS TWO LIGHT BULBS IN THE RIGHT BUT THERE’RE THEY BOTH THEY’RE BOTH THE SAME ARE RIGHT NOW
I THINK THE TOP ONE WOULD BECAUSE IT’S THEY ARE BRIGHTER
I <NOISE> THINK THAT THE BATTERY I MEAN THE LIGHT BULB WILL DIM
I THINK THEY COMPARE WITH THIS CIRCUIT BECAUSE I DON’T I DON’T KNOW
THE LIGHTS WOULD GET DIMMER
FANTASTIC HOW ARE YOU
I THINK IT IS A <BREATH> I AM NOT ACTUALLY I AM NOT ACTUALLY
I THINK IT IS FALLING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND BACKING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
I THINK THAT THERE’RE DIMMER BECAUSE ONE LIGHT +UM+ ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING ENERGY FROM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
I ACTUALLY THINK IT IF IT HAS ITS OWN ITS OWN PATHWAY IT WILL LIGHT BRIGHTLY
<SILENCE> I’M I DON’T KNOW <NOISE> ACTUALLY
I THINK THAT THE +UM+ BOTTOM ONE IS SO DIM BECAUSE ONE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING BRIGHT FORM THE OTHER LIGHT BULB
I NOTICE THAT IN ONE PICTURE IT HAS LESS WIRES AND THE OTHER PICTURE IT HAS NO WIRES
I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON WHAT STICK TO MAGNET
I REALLY DON’T KNOW
+UM+ ELECTRICITY GOES INTO ALL OF THEM AND GOES OUT ALL OF THEM
I THINK THERE’RE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE
WHAT MAKES THE BULB IS TURN OFF IS THAT ONE D CELL IS TURNED RIGHT SIDE UP IN THE OTHER D CELL IS UPSIDE DOWN SO THAT WILL NOT WORK MAY SEE THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO (*)
I DO ALSO WITH TOUCH I I WILL MISS USE
2D CELLS ARE BRIGHTER BUT 1D CELL IS NOT VERY BRIGHT AT ALL
THEY WILL GET DOT CODE AND THAT’S NOT VERY GOOD
I OBSERVED THAT THE ONE WOULD ONE D CELL IS NOT VERY BRIGHT BUT ONE MORE TWO D CELLS IS VERY VERY BRIGHT
BECAUSE WITH TWO +UM+ LIGHT BULBS THE BATTERIES ON ARE BASICALLY DEAD BUT IT CAN ALSO BE NO NEVER (*)
ELECTRICITY IN A CIRCUIT IS LIKE THE CIRCUIT IS LIKE HOLDING THE ENERGY <BREATH> AND THEN LIKE THE (*) ALL
WHAT DO YOU WHAT ELSE YOU WANT ME TO
BY FLIPPING IT OVER I GUESS
ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE FLOWING WELLBEING THROUGH THE D CELL INTO THE WIRES INTO THE WIRES AND OUT TO THE LIGHT BULB
GOOD <SILENCE> GOOD
+UM+ THE BLUE DOTS OR D +AH+ ELECTRICITY MAY BE
THIS FOLLOWING THROUGH A LIGHT BULB SO MAKE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP WE
UP TO FRESH IN IS THAT THE GOES UP TO THE D CELL AND GOES A BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THAT IS HOW IT WORK
I HAVE BEEN DOING I FORGOT BECAUSE <NOISE>
I DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
+UM+ THE D CELL +AH+ MAKES <NOISE> PROPOSE INTO LOW WIRES AND THEN THE ENERGY <BREATH> CLOSED ENERGY YOU LIKE LITTLE
THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRICITY IS LIKE GOES TO EVERYTHING AND MAY BE INTO EVERYTHING I GET
A CIRCUIT +UM+ CIRCUITS WILL BE
THEY COULD NOT TO ME ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS REMINDED (*) ELECTRICITY
I DON’T KNOW
MORE MOBES MEANS LESS LIGHT
ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH ALL THE METAL INTO LIGHT BULB
I THINK THE LIGHT BULB WOULD LIKE BRIGHTER
ON THE EXCEPT D CELL DANGEROUS THE CIRCUIT BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING BRIGHTER VERY VERY BRIGHTER
<SILENCE> GOOD HOW ARE YOU
THE CIRCUIT +UM+ GOES IS THE D CELL AND THEN THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH D CELL AND GOES TO THE PATHWAY WHICH IS THE WIRES GOES THE ENERGY GOES INTO THE WIRES AND THEN THE THE ENERGY GOES INTO THE WIRES AND THEN THE WIRE THE WIRE ENERGY INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE (*)
THERE WOULD MORE ENERGY AND THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT BRIGHT
FLOWS OUT OF THE MINUS SIGN GOES INTO THAT LIGHT BULB BECAUSE (*) LIGHT BULB AND THEN GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY LIKE A REGULAR
I FORGOT SORRY
<SILENCE> I AM I OBSERVED THAT WHENEVER YOU TAKE A LIGHT BULB AWAY FROM THE (*) IT’S NOT VERY BRIGHT-
I LIKE TO
TOOK AWAY A LITTLE TOO
I DON'T KNOW IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT
CRUISE AND GO AWESOME
PAPER *CLIPS* OKAY AND METAL UM WASHERS AND WE USED UM GRAMS TO MEASURE HOW MUCH IT *WAS* AND THAT'S
ONE THOUSAND <LAUGH>
WELL WE WOULD HAVE A MEASURING SCALE THING WE WOULD PUT IT ON THIS WAY AND IT WOULD GO LIKE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD U PUT MORE AND MORE AND MORE UNTIL IT GOT EVENED OUT
AND SO THEN WE WOULD UM OTHER PEOPLE WOULD GET BIGGER ONES IT WOULD TAKE FEW FEWER THAN OURS OURS WOULD TAKE MORE
YEAH <BREATH>
OOPS <BREATH> UM
WELL I UM I DID S UM WELL WE'RE MEASURING <FP> LIKE A BLOBBY IT'S MADE OF CLAY KID'S CLAY SO YOU CAN REMOLD IT IF YOU WANT AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SOMEWHERE AROUND SOME SOME KIND OF MILLIMETER LIKE MAYBE TWO MILLIMETERS BIG AND I PUT MINE MY IF YOU'RE DONE YOU COULD PUT A PET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT <BREATH> AND SO THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING
OKAY OH COOL
UH-HUH WELL SINCE THIS ONE WE U WE WE HAD A SMALL ONE AND SO IF WE HAD A SMALL ONE THEN WE WOULD MEASURE IT UP
IT UM THERE'S MORE BECAUSE IT WAS THERE WERE LESS WEIGHT THAN THE OTHER ONE SO THEY WOULD
WOOD PIECES WE UM DID IT A ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME AND THEN WE GOT NOT A FIVE BUT I THINK WE GOT A THREE BECAUSE IT WAS A LOT LIGHTER
WE USED PAPER CLIPS AND UH PLASTIC CHIPS AND
<LAUGH> THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN USE GRAMS LIKE A POUND OF SOMETHING
TAKE OUT A HUNDRED I KNEW IT WAS A HUNDRED GRAMS TAKE OUT A *HUNDRED* GRAMS AND THEN IT WOULD GO TONK BUT IT'S FLOATING IT'S FLOATING
THEN IT WOULD IT JUST GETS MORE AND THEN MORE AND MORE SO SINCE THERE'S NO IT WOULD BE SOLID MMM WE DID WE DID BUT WE HAD TO MEASURE SOMETHING IN THERE <LAUGH>
TOUCH WHOA
WELL WE UM WE'RE USING WE GOT A UM PLASTIC CHIP PUT IT IN WE MEASURED HOW MUCH PAPER CLIPS IT WOULD TAKE TO MAKE IT EVEN IT OUT
IT'S GOING LIKE THAT BECAUSE THERE'S MORE <FP> THERE'S THERE'S LIKE AIR IN THERE SO AIR IS LIGHTER THAN SOMETHING SOLID SO IT WOULD MAKE THE TIP
WHA- WE WERE PUTTING MORE PAPER CLIPS IN <BREATH> SO THE MORE WEIGHT ON THIS ONE WOULD MAKE IT GO HIGHER AND THEN IT WOULD FINALLY GET EVENED OUT
YEAH
OKAY BYE BYE
WELL IF IT EVENS OUT IT WOULD BE EXACTLY THE SAME WEIGHT EVEN THOUGH ONE WOULD HAVE MORE THAN THE OTHER BECAUSE ONE WOULD BE HEAVIER SO THEN IF YOU JUST PUT ONE AND ONE ONE WOULD BE LIKE THIS SEE IT'D BE LIKE THAT AND THEN THAT YOU CAN PUT GRAMS IN PUT IT IN AND THEN IF IT IT WOULD EVEN IT OUT ALL THE WAY INTO HERE BUT THEN IF YOU FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU UM PUT THAT TWENTY GRAM TEN TWENTY GRAMS RIGHT IN THERE THEN WHEN UM YOU WOULD GET OH I DON'T KNOW A TEN AND A FIVE AND A ONE THEN IF YOU COULD JUST HAVE ANOTHER WAIT IF YOU JUST PUT IN A TEN AND A TEN IT WOULD BE TWENTY IT WOULD BE EXACTLY THE SAME EVEN THOUGH THERE'S MORE IT'S LESS WEIGHT SO YOU NEED TO HAVE MORE THAN THAT
I THINK THERE'S A YEAH THERE'S MEGA GRAMS BUT WE HAVEN'T STUDIED ABOUT MEGA GRAMS SOME PEOPLE IS MENTIONING LIKE NOT KILOGRAMS BUT LIKE LIKE MEBE- MEGA GRAMS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
UM WELL I GOT WELL WHEN WE DID IT WITH A PLASTIC CHIP I THINK WE GOT A UM LIKE SOMEWHERE AROUND MAYBE FIVE SIX SEVEN I DON'T REMEMBER OR FOUR FOUR WE GOT A FOUR YEAH FOUR
BECAUSE IF THERE'S MORE IF IT WAS BIGGER IT HAD MORE METAL IN IT SO IT'D BE MORE HEAVIER AND THEN IF IF IT WAS SMALLER THEN IT IT WOULD HAVE LESS METAL AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THICK THAT ONE IS AND THAT ONE AND THAT ONE HAS MORE METAL THAN THAT ONE SO THAT ONE WOULD BE LIGHTER THAN THAT ONE
UH TWO KILOGRAMS
THAT WOR IT'S OH PUSH THEN <FP> WE'RE GONNA USE SOME BEANS AND SINCE THERE'S MORE WEIGHT HERE I BET YOU ANYTHING THOSE ARE GONNA BE LIGHT LIGHTER BEANS ARE SMALLER THAN THIS AND THIS IS MORE SOLID THAN THAT <BREATH> SO THEN MAYBE IF THIS WOULDN'T GO IN IT PROBABLY WON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE
UM TWENTY GRAMS EACH SO THAT WOULD BE TWENTY FORTY SIXTY SIXTY NINETY OH IT THAT'S A HUNDRED SO THEN A HUNDRED GRAMS
YEAH THEY'RE PROBABLY A LOT AND SO IT'S MORE BECAUSE IT'S THIS IS EXACTLY A HUNDRED GRAMS HUNDRED GRAMS BUT THIS HAS MORE BECAUSE IT'S EQUALED UP TO THIS AND THIS BECAUSE THIS PART IS EXACTLY DOWN IN THE MIDDLE IT'S EXACTLY STRAIGHT SO IT'S NOT LIKE THIS OR THAT EXACTLY YUP
GET EVEN MORE HEAVIER
<LAUGH> YEAH <BREATH> AND
IT WA INSTEAD OF ALWAYS HAVING TO USE UM JUST S SMALL LITTLE PIECES THEY CAN USE BIGGER OF ONE WHOLE THING
WELL I I KNOW SINCE I'VE BEEN BASICALLY AROUND THE WORLD I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE WATER AND I'VE BEEN HAVING CUPS OF WATER EXPERIENCED STUFF I HAD A CUP AND IT WOULD BE REALLY REALLY HEAVY AND I WAS ONLY TWO TO THREE SO THEN THAT'S HOW I KNOW THAT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF WATER COULD BE HEAVY
SIXTEEN GRAMS
UH SIXTEEN GRAMS INTO THE OH SIXTEEN MINUS THREE GRAMS EQUALS OKAY SO SIXTEEN <BREATH> FOURTEEN GRAMS THIRTEEN THIRTEEN GRAMS
WE PUT IT IN THE WATER AND AND MADE IT SOAK UP ALL THE WATERS IT CAN <BREATH> AND THEN WE WEIGHED IT AND THEN IT WEIGHED ALMOST UM THE WHOLE BACK
WATER'S A A PICTURE'S AS HEAVY AS A KILOGRAM
AND YEP AND THEN <BREATH> THAT THAT USED TO BE FULL OF AIR
<BREATH> FIFTY TWENTY PIECES BECAUSE THEY'RE EVEN HEAVIER THEY HAVE TEN WOULD BE SOMETHING
ONE HUNDRED GRAMS OH TEN ONE HUNDRED OH
ONE THOUSAND I ALREADY KNOW THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO LOOK
LOOKING FOR MASS YEAH
KILOGRAM PLUS ONE L OF WATER LITER
NO I DIDN'T I KNEW IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SIXTEEN GRAMS
WE GOT THAT PUT THE WATER SOAKED IT UP PUT IT THERE WEIGHED IT PUT ANOTHE- PUT UM THE GRAMS THERE AND THEN
KILOGRAM IS TWO HUNDRED UM FIVE GRAMS TWO HUNDRED OF FIVE GRAMS
ONE HUNDRED TEN GRAMS
YEAH IT'S IT'S STILL THE FUN PART TOO
IT'S *ABSORBING* THE WATER
FIRST WE UM GOT THE SPONGE W WE UM MEASURED WE WEIGHED THE UM NOT THE WET SPONGE BUT THE DRY SPONGE
WATER
SO THIS WOULD BE THREE GRAMS AND THIS WOULD BE SIXTEEN THE WATER
KILOGRAM
AND THEN
UM WHEN YOU'RE BASICALLY WHEN YOU'RE JUST A SCIENTIST YOU SHOULD MEASURE LIKE YOU WOULD USE KILOGRAMS AND F THERE'S PROBABLY MMM NO <BREATH>
YEP
OH KILOGRAM THAT'S A KILOGRAM
YES IF THE AIRLOCK IF ALL THE AIRLOCK IS GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
ONE THOUSAND
WELL A SPONGE IS MORE SMALLER AND MORE EFFICIENT BECAUSE YOU CAN REUSE AND REUSE IT BUT AND SO IT CAN ABSORB MORE THAN THE CLOTH
OKAY SO YOU CAN GO BACK UP TO HERE
UH YEAH THAT WAS FUN
YEP AND THEN IT GETS HEAVIER AND HEAVIER AND HEAVIER BECAUSE THE WATER'S HEAVY
THE FIVE TEN IT'S IT'S LIKE SHRINKING SHRINKING RIGHT HERE BUT RIGHT HERE IT'S GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER AND SMALLER
MMM LOOKING AT THE COMPUTER
YEP YOU HAVE A SCALE AND THEN YOU WEIGH YOUR FRUITS YOUR VEGETABLES AND
BUT THE DRY SPONGE DIDNE- DID NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE THAT AT ALL NO
AND THAT ONE WOULD BE TEN GRAMS <BREATH> BECAUSE IT'S IT STILL HAS A LOTTA
YEP <LAUGH> YEP CLEANING UH WE YOU CAN E IF YOU MAKE A SPILL YOU CAN ALSO USE THAT INSTEAD OF A TOWEL *TOWEL* TOWEL'S ARE USING INSTEAD OF UM LIKE SPONGE KINDA STUFF THEY USE CLOTH AND CLOTH STILL ABSORBS BUT
YEAH
THAT'S A FIVE AND THEN THAT'S A ONE THEN
N MMM
YOU HAVE LESS THE AMOUNT
WELL IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS BUT SEP WITH NO WATER IN IT
TO CLEAN WET AND WITH DIRTY WATER WOULD *ABSORB* THE DIRTY WATER MMM HMM
KILOGRAM
YEP
MMM HMM WELL WE GOT A DRY SPONGE AND WE WEIGHED IT SEEING HOW MUCH MONEY ER HOW MUCH <BREATH> UM IT WEIGHED AND IT ONLY WEIGHED ONE OUNCE OR TWO OUNCES
THREE GRAMS
IT'S SAYING THAT THAT'S EQUAL TO THE SAME SO WE TAKE IT OUT THEN WE GET IT WET AND IS WEIGHS THREE GRAMS ALREADY SO THEN WE GET IT WET
UH-HUH YEP
SO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS THERE'S A THEY'RE PUTTING A SPONGE IN A CUP OF WATER SO THEY CAN WEIGH HOW MUCH IT IS
EMPTY *CUPS* CUPS ARE LIKE AIR LIGHT
WE USED GRAMS AND THEN WE WOULD PUT MORE MORE MORE UNTIL IT WOULD EVEN OUT AND THEN THIS WOULD BE THREE GRAMS B BECAUSE IT'S <BREATH> HEAVIER THAN THE ONES WE USED WE USED AT LEAST TWO GRAMS ONE GRAM
YOU KNOW WHAT'S COOL IS YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO TAP OF THAT YOU CAN TAP THIS PART
TEN GRAMS WITH FIVE GRAMS
UH YEAH
YEAH
THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
AND THEN WHEN WE UM WE PUT IT IN THE
WELL UM THERE'S AIRLOCK AIR UH LOCKET INSIDE OF EM
IT WOULD JUST GET REALLY HEAVY
YEP
PUT IT ON THE SCALE AND IT WEIGHS
AND THEN THAT'S THAT'S EQUALED OUT SO THAT'LL BE FIFTEEN GRAMS SIXTEEN GRAMS *EVENED* OUT AND THAT'S IT
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ACTUALLY WAIT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU CLICK ON THAT ONE
A THOUSAND
GRAMS GRAMS
WELL A KILOGRAM IS HEAVIER THAN A NORMAL GRAM SO A KILOGRAM IS PROBABLY GONNA BE AS HEAVY AS
TWENTY GRAMS OR TWENTY G'S
HI <LAUGH>
THEN WE GOT IT WET SOAKED UP ALL THE WATERS IT COULD THEN WE WEIGHED IT AGAIN
AND THEN WE PUT IT IN
WELL THERE'S UM AIR LOCKETS THAT *ABSORB* WATER LIKE WHAT IT SHOWS RIGHT THERE AND IT SPITS OUT THE AIR AND IT MAKES IT BUBBLE
UM THREE GRAMS
(())
IT WON'T SMELL THE EARTH WELL THE TREE IT WON'T BE GOOD FOR THE TREES AND EVERYTHING
SEE THE FLAME IT AND THEN THE WAS IS LIKE A PERSON AND IT'S RUNNING BECAUSE THE HEAT IS TOO HOT FOR EXAMPLE THE SUN IF IT'S SO SUNNY WE GET HOT AND WE WE BECAUSE IT'S A SOURCE OF LIGHT AND ENERGY IT'S HEAT ENERGY
(()) BECAUSE UM THE COAL HAS BEEN BURNED AND THE GAS HASN'T I GUESS
I SEE THREE APPLES UM LIKE A LITTLE DESK A CANDLE TWO LOGS AND GAS
SEE THE GIRL IS USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS WALKING AND SHE SHE'S LOSING SHE'S LOSING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE'S WALKING BUT WITH THE APPLE SHE'S GETTING FOOD ENERGY WHICH IS GIVING HER MORE ENERGY TO KEEP ON WALKING
THE AN APPLE AND THREE APPLES AND A SOLAR PAN
UM SHE'S GETTING THE ENERGY BY HER THAT APPLE SHE'S EATING
SMELLS ALL FOGGY AND STUFF AND IT DOESN'T SMELL GOOD AND SO AND SO THAT I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA BE GOOD FOR TREES ENVIRONMENT OR US EVEN BECAUSE THE GAS IF YOU BURN IT TO THE COAL IT'S NOT GONNA BE GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
NO
UM IT'S THE WAX IS FALLING OFF BECAUSE THE FIRE IS BURNING IT AND SO UM THE WAX IS FALLING OFF BECAUSE THE CANDLE IS GETTING HEAT AND HEAT IS PART OF ENERGY SO IT'S MELTING
WELL I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA WORK BECAUSE GAS ISN'T A SOURCE OF ENERGY
UM WELL THE WAX IS MELTING BECAUSE THE FIRE IS A IS HEAT AND HEAT IS A WAY TO TO FROM ENERGY AND ENERGY IS REALLY REALLY (())
HEAT ENERGY HEAT ENERGY IS ANOTHER SOURCE OF ENERGY
I SEE A SOLAR PANEL THREE APPLES THE LITTLE TABLE THREE I MEAN TWO LOGS AND A WINDSHIELD AND IN THE OTHER SIDE I SEE COAL AND AND A GAS
THAT UM THE THEY BOTH HAVE A THEY BOTH USE A BATTERY AND THEY BOTH NEED THE SUNLIGHT OR HEAT LIGHTS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO WORK
THE (()) THE HEATS IN THE FIRE BECAUSE HEAT IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU IF THE LIGHTS IF WE DIDN'T HAVE LIGHTS WE WOULDN'T WE WOULD BE FREEZING RIGHT NOW AND UM HEAT IS ANOTHER SOURCE OF ENERGY THAT'S WHY WE NEED LIGHTS AND WE NEED HEATS
WORTH THAT MUCH BECAUSE IT'S NONRENEWABLE
I UH I SEE HANDS (()) THE TAMBOURINE AND MAKING MUSIC AND UH IT'S GIVING OUT SOUND ENERGY AND THE PERSON IS GIVING IT'S ENERGY TO THE TAMBOURINE SO THEN IT COULD MAKE NOISE AND THAT IS WE HAVE ENERGY TOO WE HAVE FOOD ENERGY AND SLEEP ENERGY BUT THE ONE'S THAT USING RIGHT NOW IS THE THE A SOUND MUSIC SOUND ENERGY IT'S A REALLY NICE UH
UM WOOD WOOL YARN WOOD STICK SPONGE RUBBER BAND RIVER ROCK PLASTIC STRAW PLASTIC CHIP CARDBOARD AND BLACK ROCK THOSE ARE IT
HAVE ENERGY WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO MUCH THINGS AND IF WE DIDN'T HAVE ENERGY AND THE LIGHT WE WOULDN'T IT WOULD BE ALL DARK AND EVERYTHING AND WHEN YOU GO TO SCHOOL YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL FREAKED OUT AND YOU'RE GONNA RUN INTO PEOPLE BECAUSE THE LIGHT ISN'T ON
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE A SOURCE OF ENERGY
I I THINK THE GIRL IS WALKING AND SHE'S WALKING REALLY FAR AND SHE'S LOSING ENERGY SHE'S LOSING UM SLEEP ENERGY AND EATING ENERGY AND BUT SHE'S EATING AN APPLE WHICH IS GETTING HER MORE ENERGY SO SHE CAN KEEP WALK
I THINK THEY MIGHT UM THEY MIGHT CONTAIN HEAT HEATS BECAUSE I KNOW IF YOU IF YOU DO THAT THEY WILL MAKE FIRE AND FIRE IS A HEAT IS A ENERGY HEAT
SMELLS LIKE GAS BECAUSE UM IT'S UH IT'S A SMELL ENERGY AND IT SMELLS REALLY BAD BECAUSE IT'S DUST
WELL UM UH I KNOW THAT FOOLS FUEL FUELS HELP US WITH ENERGY BECAUSE IT HAS A SOURCE OF IT'S A SOURCE OF UM
BECAUSE UH THEY BOTH NEED THE SUN AND THEY BOTH USE THEY BOTH ARE UM FUELS AND THEY BOTH USE D THE BATTERY
IT IT DIDN'T SOUND MUCH IT JUST WENT THE WAX MELTED AND DROPPED I HEARD THAT BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE
BYE
YOU'RE GIVING OUR YOUR ENERGY BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING YOU'RE GETTING IT ALL FOCUSED ON THE SOUND AND HOW YOU WANT IT
BECAUSE THEY USE THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND USE BECAUSE THE BATTERY USES YEAH BECAUSE THE
I THINK THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GAS AND THE COAL FUELS IS BECAUSE UM THE COAL FUELS DON'T IT UM THE COAL FUELS ARE BURNED AND BLACK BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN USED FOR HEAT ENERGY WHICH IS A FIRE BUT GAS ISN'T A SOURCE THAT MUCH IT IF YOU CAN COUNT SMELL (())
THE APPLE AND HER FEET
GOOD
OLD RENEWABLE
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
WE'VE BEEN BUILDING SERIES OF CIRCUITS
THE WAX IS MELTING BECAUSE THE THE FLAME IS MELTING IT AND IF YOU GET TOO HOT TO THE LITTLE FLAME YOU UH YOU COULD GET REALLY HOT SO IT MELTS
I SEE THE CANDLE AND THE LITTLE BLACK YARN IS HAS A FIRE AND THE FIRE'S MELTING THE WAS AND THE WAS IS GOING IT'S ONCE DRIPPED
WARM BECAUSE IT'S A IT FEELS WARM BECAUSE IT'S A SOURCE OF ENERGY AND WE NEED ENERGY TO BE WARM AND FIRE IS A SOURCE
IT'S HEATING UP THE WAX AND SHOWING OFF
BECAUSE THE WAX IT IT'S MELTING
ANY MORE
<NO VOICE>
TO THAT CURRENT STOPS
THAT'S REASON
BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS IN BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS IN THERE
+AA+ WAIT I AM GETTING SOMETHING OUT SOMETHING <SILENCE> +AA+ LET WE SEE OKAY GOT THAT (*) +AA+ THEY BURNS OUT OKAY
WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE IT’S STANDARD IS DOESN’T WORK
SEE THAT I HAD RECEIVED A PARALLEL CIRCUIT A SERIES CIRCUIT +AA+
I DON’T KNOW
THESE WIRES HOLD LIKE ENERGY AND STUFF <SILENCE>
I DON’T KNOW
THERE IS A SWITCH FOR A NEW ONE
BREAK
THEY ARE ALL USING ONE BATTERY AND LIKE THERE ARE USING A WIRE AND THEY ARE ALL USING THE YEAH LIKE SO WAIT THAT IT ANOTHER ONE IS HAVING OUT IN THROUGH THE WIDEST SIDE IS OUT OUT THROUGH THE WIDEST SIDE IT IS A PLUG
<SILENCE> I NOTICED THAT IT DOESN’T WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS
OF THE BATTERY
MAY IT DOESN’T WORK OR REALLY THE OTHER ONE DOESN’T WORK
YOU KNOW THAT IS
THAT ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS BROKE<SILENCE>
SERIES CIRCUIT
THINK THE LIGHT BULB AT THE MIDDLE DOESN’T WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE THAT’S LIKE OLD OR IT IS GETTING TOO MUCH ELECTRICITY AT THEY TREAT IT AND THEN IF ONE LIGHT BULB GOES OUT AND IT GOES THREE IT DOES IT THE TWO OF THE LIGHT BULBS DON’T WORK BUT WHEN YOU CHANGE THE LIGHT BULB THEY ARE BRIGHT AGAIN
WOULD YOU SPEAK A LIGHT IS PARTY
IT BREAKS
+AA+<SIDE SPEECH>
YOU KNOW HOW STREET LIGHT LOOK BUT IF YOU USE (*) LET’S SAY BOTH ARE ON KIND BUT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS A COMPLETE ONE A SERIES CIRCUIT IS COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS LIKE WAY BETTER BECAUSE LAST TIME I SHOW THAT WITH YOU A PARALLEL CIRCUIT WAS BRIGHTER THAN A SERIES CIRCUIT MAY BE BECAUSE THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO BATTERIES AND THE AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT HASN’T ONLY ONE
+AA+ THERE WERE THE LIGHT BULBS WERE LIGHTING BUT THERE IS THE OTHER ONE BROKE AS THEY DID A STUFF LIGHT I GET THAT THEY GOT IT OTHER ONE AND IT STARTED LIGHTING AND THAT
+AA+ WE REALLY IT DOESN’T WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE LIKE WELL WHAT ARE LIGHT BULBS DOES WORK BUT THE OTHER ONE
MAY BE BECAUSE THE SWITCH MAY BE BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS LIKE (*) STUFF AND WELL THAT HOW WAS HOLDED AND ELECTRICITY AND STUFF SO YEAH
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FORCE BETWEEN A MAGNET AND WEAK BETWEEN <BREATHE> HOW COULD YOU (*) INTO A MAGNET THAT TURNS ON AND OFF
<NO VOICE>
BECAUSE IT DOESN’T WORK
LIGHT BULB GROW SO IT DOESN’T WORK SO THAT IT HAS TO BE DIFFERENT ANOTHER
I WAS (*) +AA+ THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT BECAUSE THE ENERGY WAS GOING THAT ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY AT WAS GOING BUT THEN THE SWITCH WAS GOING SINCE THE SWITCH WAS GOING WAS NOT AT ALL IT IS A WORK
BULB STARTS WORKING BECAUSE LIKE WITH THE SWITCH WAS OUT IT WAS HOLD THAT ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT BULB
WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A BATTERY THAT THIS THREE WIRES THERE IS A SWITCH
A SERIES
THE ETHYLENE WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE IT’S LIKE ALREADY DRIED OUT AND START
THE LIGHT THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE IS BROKEN AND THEN WHAT THEY DO WHAT THEY WILL WAS IT DOESN’T WORK
LIGHT IS
IT’S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
ANY MORE THIS CAN NO LIGHT GETTING
WELL IF IT I KNOW A SERIES CIRCUIT ALL THESE AS A ONE BATTERY AND IT HAS A ONE OR TWO LIGHT BULBS AND IT HAS THREE OR FOUR OR TWO LIGHT WIRES AND THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS TWO BATTERIES SO TWO BATTERIES HAS FOUR WIRES HAS TWO LIGHT BULBS ALL ABOUT LIGHT BULB LIGHTS BRIGHT BRIGHTER THAN A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE IF YOU USE WORD LIGHT BULB ON A SERIES CIRCUIT THE LIGHT BULB MUCH BETTER TO PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT WILL MIGHT SO BIG IT WOULD BE AWESOME LIKE A FIRE WORK
THE FLOW THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH ALL THREE WIRES
A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
BROKEN THEY DOESN’T LIGHT ANYONE
I DON'T KNOW
I SEE THAT LIGHT BULB IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS IN ON IS LIKE HOLDING THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH LIGHT BULB
IT’S NOT WORKING ANYMORE
<NO VOICE>
IT’S TWO WIRE TWO LIGHT BULBS THERE WILL BE MAY BE BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS TOO HIGH IT BURNED OUT SO THAT ARE THEY HAD TREAT THAT LIGHT BULB THE OLD LIGHT BULB I KNOW IT’S STARTED LIGHTING AGAIN
+AA+ MAY BE BECAUSE IT’S GETTING TOO MUCH LIGHT <SILENCE>
WE HAD SEEN A SERIES CIRCUIT AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
LIGHT BULB BROKE AND IT DOESN’T
IT WILL WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE IT’S LIKE +UM+ THAT STRATEGIES HOLD BACK
BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS <SILENCE> <MUSIC>
SERIES CIRCUIT
BECAUSE YOU LET ME GO WHAT YOU WERE TALKING AND I AM (*)
I WILL NOT KNOW ACTUALLY
NO BODY AND CAN I PUT TO USE JUST WITH WHAT IS (*)
I THINK THAT THE BATTERY
IT WILL WORK MAY BE
<SIDE SPEECH> ALL INSIDE IT AND THEN IT WANT
GOOD
I SEE THAT THE MOTOR IS MOVING BECAUSE WHEN I PUT THE PAPER CLIP ON TOP OF THE SWITCH IT STARTED TO MOVE
INSULATORS OR SOMETHING THAT ARE METAL AND THE MORE METAL IT IS THE BETTER THE MOTOR IS GOING TO WORK BECAUSE THEY NEEDS METAL AND STORED ENERGY SO GET WORKING AND SINCE YOU ALREADY HAVE STORED ENERGY INTO THE D CELL OR BATTERY ITS HELPING THE WIRES GET ENERGY AND FLOW THROUGH THE SWITCH AND IN THE METALS HELP THE SWITCH GO BACK AND START THE MOTOR
(*)
I MEAN THAT IS NOT GETTING ENERGY BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS AT ON AND THE WOOD STICK IS LIKE ISN’T A TYPE OF METAL SO IT WON’T WORK
IT DOESN’T WORK BECAUSE IT’S NOT LIKE STORE OF ENERGY AND BECAUSE A BATTERY WORKS BECAUSE THAT HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT SO
I HIT THE NAIL THE NAIL IS +HM+ WORKING BECAUSE IT’S A STORED METAL SO WHEN I TURNED IT TO THE SWITCH ITS STARTED TO WORKING VERY WELL AND THE LITTLE FLY ONE MORE JUST TRIED IN MOVING BECAUSE I WAS GETTING ENERGY
+UM+ CONDUCTING MATERIALS ARE HELPFUL BUT THE REST OF THAT AREN’T WHERE IT’S TO OTHER WAY OVER CAN YOU TELL THAT MARNIE
TO IT WHEN YOU PUT THAT PAPER CLIP THERE THE SWITCH IS TURNED ON SO THEN I AM IT’S THE BATTERY IS GIVING ALL THE ENERGY TO THE WIRES AND TO THE SWITCH SO THAT WHEN THE PAPER CLIP PUSHES IT ITS STARTS THE MOTOR STARTS TO WORK
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO COMPLETE A CIRCUIT
I +UM+ SAID THAT YOU NEED A BATTERY WHICH HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT AND THEN +UM+ YOU NEED TWO WIRES A SWITCH AND A MOTOR
AN INSULATOR HAS THE MOTOR GET ENERGY BECAUSE THE MORE ENERGY I GETS THE BATTERY LIKE (*) AND IF YOU DON’T KNOW MORE ABOUT STORED ENERGY I KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT LIKE A BATTERY HAS STORED ENERGY BECAUSE ITS WAITING TO GET USED SO YOU IT’S LIKE ITS ENERGY STORED INTO SOMETHING SO THEN WHENEVER YOU WANT TO USE IT ITS WIDE OPEN AND HAS STORED ENERGY EXAMPLE IS IF YOU HAD A +UM+ IF YOU HAD A IF YOU HAD
SO
THE MOTOR IS MOVING ITS LITTLE FLAG BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS TURNED ON
ITS STARTS TO MOVE BECAUSE IT’S LIKE LIKE HAPPY ITS ENERGY
<NOISE>
INSULATORS ARE HELPFUL
THE CIRCUIT WILL RUN BECAUSE IT IS LIKE ITS METAL AND IN ORDER FOR IT TOWARDS THAT NEEDS METAL
BECAUSE IT’S NOT A SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY OR A PIECE OF ENERGY
THAT THERE IS A BATTERY AND THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES ARE GIVING ENERGY TO THE MOTOR BUT +UM+ THE SWITCH IS ON AND- BECAUSE THE NAIL IS MAKING IT GO ON
THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOOD ON THE WOOD STICK IT IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT’S NOT TYPE OF METAL OR ITS TYPE OF SOURCE TO MAKE IT
THE LIGHT BULB WIRES AND A BATTERY
I DON’T KNOW
WIRES YOU CAN'T- LIKE IF THERE'S A BATTERY I MEAN IF YOU HAD WIRES YOU COULD MAYBE PUT THE WIRES NEXT TO THE BATTERY AND IT'LL GIVE THE LIGHT BULB SOME ENERGY
I NOTICED THAT WHEN I PUSHED THE D-CELL IT TURNED AROUND SO THAT THE MINUS SIGN IS NOW GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE PLUS SIGN IS GETTING THE ENERGY FROM THE OTHER WIRE
THEY'RE STORED ENERGY
NO
YEAH BATTERY GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB
BYE
I DON’T KNOW
+UH+ THE WIRES ARE GIVING LESS ENERGY TO THE D-CELL THE PLUS SIGN
THAT THE BATTERY THE MINUS SIDE IS GIVING THE ENERGY TO THE RIGHT WIRE AND THE RIGHT WIRE IS GIVING THE ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE WIRE ON THE LEFT IS RESTORING THE ENERGY IN THE PLUS SIGN AND THE
ENERGY AND HOW IT WORKS
ENERGY BECAUSE BATTERIES HAVE STORED ENERGY AND IF YOU PUT THE WIRES NEXT TO THE BATTERIES AND YOU PUT THE WIRES NEXT TO A LIGHT BULB IT MIGHT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE GET- THE +UM+ BATTERY IS GIVING THE WIRES ENERGY SO IT CAN GIVE- IT’S
WON'T WORK ANYMORE
+UM+ THE WIRES ARE GIVING ELECTRICITY TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND THEN THE LIGHT BULBS THAT RECEIVE THE ENERGY +ER+ WELL IT- THE WIRES ARE GIVING ELECTRICITY TO THE LIGHT BULB THE ENERGY IS GETTING- THE BATTERY ISN'T GETTING EN- ENOUGH ENERGY ANYMORE
GOOD
<SILENCE>
THE D-CELL THE BATTERY
NO
TURN AROUND THE BATTERY
I NOTICE THAT THE WIRES ARE MOVING WHENEVER I PUSHED
ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY
THE- I DON’T THINK IT’S SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE EACH ENDS
YOU DON'T CONNECT THE- TO THE TWO WIRES TO THE BATTERY THE BA- YOU WON’T BE GETTING ANY ENERGIES FOR THE LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP OR ANYTHING BECAUSE THE D-CELL HAS +UM+ STORED UP ENERGY IN THERE
THE RIGHT
I DON’T KNOW
WELL +UM+ LIGHT BULBS HELP YOU A LOT BECAUSE IF IT’S RAINING OR SOMETHING YOU CAN LIKE TURN ON THE LIGHT BULB AND IT WILL BE LIKE DARK OR ANYTHING
THEY HAVE- THEY HELP YOU SEE BETTER LIKE IF IT’S REALLY DARK YOU CAN JUST TURN THE LIGHT BULB ON AND THE LIGHT BULB ON AND IT'LL GIVE YOU
THAT S- THE WIRE ON THE RIGHT IS GIVING THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE- THE ENERGY THAT THE LIGHT BULB ALREADY USED IS GOING TO BE RESTORED IN THE PLUS SIGN OF THE D-CELL
+UM+ IT MEANS THAT THE- THAT BULB GETS ENERGY AND IT LIGHT- LIGHTS UP THE- SO WE CAN SEE BETTER
I DON’T KNOW
I DON’T KNOW
OKAY
+UM+ EVERY TIME THE ENERGY IS GOING TO LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULBS LIKE WASTE THE ENERGY
IT GOES BACK TO ITS NORMAL SHAPE
CONNECTING THE SERIES CIRCUIT LIKE IT WOULD NOT BE THE BRIGHT ANYMORE WELL IT WILL BE BRIGHT BECAUSE IT’S ONLY USED I THINK IT WON’T WORK AND I THINK REALLY WORK LIGHT BULBS
+UM+ MAY BE BECAUSE IF THE WIRES ARE THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRE AND THAT’S WHY THE LIGHT BULB IS SHINING AND ITS VERY VERY VERY VERY BRIGHT
I THINK THAT IS THE WIRE IS GETTING ENERGY AND ITS GOING INTO THE LIGHT BULBS SO THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS ARE LIKE THE ENERGY COMING
WELL I THINK THAT THE LIGHT THE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY AND LIKE THAT’S WAS JUST SPEAKING THE LIGHT BULB BRIGHTER
I DON’T KNOW
ITS +AA+ IT WAS THE LIGHT BULBS TURN BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT’S USING TWO BATTERIES AND SO THAT IS TWO STORED ENERGIES INTO LIGHT BULBS
THE ENERGY STORED IN THAT BECAUSE IT’S GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS
THAT THE ENERGY FLOWING
IT’S LIKE THE ENERGY IS GIVING THE ENERGY IT’S CALLED TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THAT’S HOW ITS GIVING ENERGY I GUESS
+AM+ I THINK THE WORK MAY BE
OF THE ELECTRICITY IS THE WIRES BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE BECAUSE ARE GETTING ENERGY AND THEN FROM THE WIRES IS THE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING ENERGY FROM BOTH SIDES BECAUSE THE BATTERY OR THE D CELL IS GIVING GIVING THE BATTERY GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRES SO THE MINUS SIDE IS ACTUALLY THE ONE THAT’S GIVING THE ENERGY TO THE WIRE AND SO THAT ONES IS CONNECTING TO THE LITTLE SIDE AND THE PLUG AND THEN THE ONE THAT LIKE THE ENERGY THAT’S THE MINUS SIDE LET ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND LIKE SPINNING OF ROUND LITTLE BUBBLES OF WEAR AND STUFF AND ITS DROPPING TO FLOOR COMING TO THE BOTTOM CONNECTING TO THE WIRE ON THE BOTTOM AND THEN IT GOES IT GOES THROUGH THE PLUS SIGN
<NO VOICE>
I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GOING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT’S USING TO TUBE A D CELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY SO IT WILL WORK
BECAUSE THAT THE MINUS SIDE IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRES AND SO LIKE THE EVERGREEN INTO THE EVERGREEN THOUGH ENERGY IS GOING INTO THE WIRE AND ITS COMING OUT THROUGH ITS GOING AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB SO THE LIGHT BULB CAN LIKE SHINE VERY BRIGHT BECAUSE ITS GETTING ENERGY AND EVERYTHING AND THEN THE BULB THAT ARE ALREADY USED ITS GIVING IT’S THE OTHER LIGHT BULB AND IS COMING BACK TO THE D CELL
THE D CELL IS GIVING IS GIVING THE WIRES ENERGY FROM THE MINUS SIDE AND ITS GOING AND IN THE OTHER WIRES LIKE LIGHTING UP AND JUST LIKE REALLY BRIGHT BECAUSE THE TWO WIRES ARE GIVING IT (*)
LEARNING +AM+ WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO COMPLETE A PARALLEL WHAT DO YOU SERVE HOW ABOUT METALS STICK TO WHAT MATERIALS THAT
SHE LIKE I TOLD YOU THE MINUS SIDE IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULB ON THIS SIDE ON THEN LIKE LITTLE BUBBLES OF ENERGY ARE COMING AND SO IT WOULD BE BRIGHTER AND THE ENERGY THAT’S ALREADY BEEN USED IS GOING THROUGH THE OTHER ONE AND DOING THE SAME THING AND THEN WHEN ITS ALL OVER IT GOES INTO THE PLUS SIDE OF THE D CELL
BECAUSE THEY NEEDS ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLUS OF THE WIRES AND THERE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TOUCHING
HE IS A COMPLETE FORMAT FOR A LIGHT BULB TO WORK
IT’S TO BE TOUCHING D CELL AND THE WIRES BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE GOING TO GAIN ENERGY AND BY THAT ONE IS GOING TO BE LIKE A REALLY FUN AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO JUST GET ON THE LAST PART
THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOUR THERE IS FOUR PATH WAYS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT
<SIDE SPEECH> <NO VOICE>
FLOW IN LIKE THE BATTERY AND IT HAS TO (*) HAS TO GO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THE WIRES THE D CELL AS TO GO THROUGH +UU+ LIGHT HAS TO GO THROUGH IT HAS LOT OF THINGS
IT’S JUST TO BE IN A CIRCLE IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE THEY HAS BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS GIVING IN ENERGY TO THE D CELL THAT’S HOW THE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING THE ENERGY IMPROVEMENT
BECAUSE THEY ARE COMING THROUGH THE D CELL AND THE D CELL HAS STORED ENERGY SO IF YOU LIKE ACTUALLY TAKEN NO NOT THE STORED ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY THE STORED ENERGY TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES ARE GIVING THE STORED ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND THEN ITS PASSING IT ALL OVER AGAIN INTO THE D CELL AGAIN
THAT WHEN THOSE ONE LIGHT BULB IT JUST ONE FOCUS AND LIKE WHEN THERE IS A ONE BATTERY IT DOESN’T LIGHT AS MUCH AS THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE THERE IS TWO FOR EACH ONE
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
THEY SEE A LATER
ELECTRICITY
THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE METAL IS TOUCHING
THAT THEY CAN CONNCET TO EACH OF THEM BUT IF THERE IF THE TWO WIRES BOTH AT THE BASE OF THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB <SIDE_SPEECH> IT GOING TO LIGHT UP HAS IT DOESN’T KNOW
NOW ITS GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY BUT ITS GOING SAME WAY BUT IF WAS  TURNED AROUND THEY WOULD BE GO IN THE OPPOSITE WAY
THAT THERE IS LIKE THE ELECTRICITY (*) THE LIGHT BULB
LIGHT
IT AS HOW YOU ELECTRICITY WAS TO WIRES
ITS GOING THE DIFFERENT WAY ITS GOING LIKE THEN POSITIVE SIDE GO IN THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOING THESE WAY SO ITS GOING TO THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE <SIDE_SPEECH> BUT EVEN LIGHT BULB IS MUST BE ONE TO THE THAT’S I BUT ANYWAY ITS GOING THE OTHER
THE REALLY THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE ONE POSITIVE
<SIDE_SPEECH> OKAY
COMPLETE CIRCUITS
DO YOU THINK ELECTRICITY
TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
I DON'T KNOW
IT LIGHT UP LIKE IN HER ON A LAMP<NOISE> ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND IT GOES THROUGH UP <SIDE_SPEECH> AND THEN STILL MAKE US BACK UP
IT WOULDN’T WORK
<SIDE_SPEECH> ITS NEGATIVE IN POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTED TO LIGHT BULB
THE NEGATIVE
THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH
THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE AND POSITVIE SIDE AND THEN <SIDE_SPEECH> THE NEGATIVE GOES TO THE SIDE OF THE METAL OF LIGHT BULB AND THEN POSITVE SIDE GOES UP IN LIGHT BULBS ARE PRODUCES THE ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
ELECTRICITY
IF THE CIRCUIT
THE ELECTRICITY
I NOTICED THAT THE FLIP THIS THAT SHOULD I NOTICED THAT IF YOU'D PUT PUT IT TO THE NOT THE NEGATIVE SIDE THEY WILL GO UP THAT WAY BUT THE PEOPLE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THEN YOU KNOW GO THE SAME WAY THAT IT WAS IN THE BEGIN
BATTERY LIGHT BULB AND WIRE
I’M GOOD
ITS FLOWING THROUGHT THE LIGHT BULB AND TO THE POSITIVE SIDE <SIDE_SPEECH>
<SIDE_SPEECH> BOTH SIDE
<NOISE> THAN IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE BA-ARE THE TWO BASES OF BULB AROUND (*) <SIDE_SPEECH> LIGHTS MUST GO UP THE LIGHT BULB SO I WERE WORK EASIER
THE PLY IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES AS WE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULB THEN ORDER OF TWO
IT HAS TO TAKE A PATH WHEN YOU COLLECT IT
ELECTRICITY
IT WOULD BECAUSE IT’S NOT REALLY SUNNY
IT DOESN’T WORK
GOOD
BECAUSE THE SWITCHES OFF AND IT’S CREATING A CIRCUIT ELECTRICITY ALL AWAY TO THAT (*) MOTOR
IT DOESN’T WORK
IT DOESN’T WORK
IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT’S NOT CREATING ELECTRICITY
IT WORKS
THE FLAG MOVES
BECAUSE IF IT DOESN’T HAVE IF THE SUN HAS TO HIT THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION THERE THEN IT WILL WORK
WHEN I CLICK THE SWITCH AND IT GOES ON THE METAL IT WORKS AND GOES TO THE MOTOR CIRCUIT IT CREATE ELECTRICITY OVER THAT IT IS ON IT WON’T WORK
THAT PUT DOES THE ELECTRICITY
WHAT
OKAY
THE FLAG IS BEEN MOVING BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS TO BE (*)
(*)
THE CELL HAS TO BE HITTING IT
AND TILL
WE’VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
ELECTRICITY
IT’S CREATING A CIRCUIT THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
THAT IT RUNS WHEN THE FLAG MOVES BECAUSE THE CELL IS GAIN ELECTRICITY FROM THE SUN THAT TWO WIRES ARE HITTING THE MOTOR SO WAS THE TWO WIRES MAKE ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR THEN THE FLAG MOVE
NO
IT MAKES IT WORK
THAT IT’S OFF THE D CELL IT’S OFF THIS THE METAL SO IT WON’T MOVE THE FLAG
THE CELL IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR SET UP THE TWO WIRES ALL THE WAY TO THE CELL SO WHILE THOUGH THAT CELL DOES HITTING IT IT STARTS WORKING
WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE CELL ITS STARTS WORKING WILL (*) A STOPS WORKING
LET THE SWITCH HAS TO BE OFF
IT DOESN’T WORK
THE CELL IS HITTING THE MOTOR SO WHEN THE CELL HITS THE MOTOR THE WIRES IT ALWAYS TO THAT CELL AND THAT IT’S START WORKING
THE D CELL IS PUT DOES THE ELECTRICITY ALL AWAY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG MOVE
IT IS HAVING THE ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKE A FLAG MOVE
IT WOULDN’T WORK BECAUSE THAT’S BE SEMI AND MIKE HAS BEEN GETTING IT
<SIDE SPEECH> AND ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH THE TWO WIRES TO MAKE A FLAG MOVE BECAUSE THE FLAG IS METAL ON BOTH SIDES SO THE METAL TOUCHES THAT IT TURNS ON MAKE THROUGH ELECTRICITY
MAGNET
THE FLAG MOVES
<SIDE SPEECH> THAT WHEN I TOUCH IT IT MOVES AND THEN I TOUCH IT AGAIN IT MOVES OFF THE CIRCUIT SO IT WILL PRODUCE THE ELECTRICITY BUT WON’T DOES TOUCH THE METAL AND PRODUCES ELECTRICITY
BECAUSE <SIDE SPEECH> WHEN THE WIRE FIX THE D CELL AND OTHER ELECTRICITY DOESN’T LIKE CONTRACTED LIKE THEY CONTRACTED TOO
<SIDE SPEECH> BECAUSE THEY DIDN’T THEN IT WHAT IF WORK AS WELL AS A IT’S DOWN SO WHILE WE ITS DARK ANYTHING OUTSIDE WILL NOT WORK
WELL IF SUN IS SHARING THE CELL THEN ITS WORKING BUT WHEN IT GOES OFF THERE IS NO WORK AND THE FLAG WILL
<SIDE SPEECH> THE FLAG MOVES
WE’VE HAS BEEN CREATING CIRCUIT
THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH <SIDE SPEAKERS>
<SIDE SPEECH> THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND UNTIL IT’S CELL AND THEN IT GOES INTERACT WHEN WILL CONTRACTION AND THEN IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
<SIDE SPEECH> THE CELL HAS BEHIND THE SUN AND THEN THE WIRES CONNECT ALL THE WAY TO THE CONTRACTION AND THEN MAKE REFLECTIVE SO ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE FEW THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER
<SIDE SPEECH> IT’S SHOWING JUST CIRCUIT AND JUST THE D CELL IS GOING AROUND AT BOTH OF THOSE ACCORDING AROUND SO IT CAN HIT THAT WITH A MOTOR AND THEN THE FLAG WILL MOVE
THE D CELLS ELECTRICITY MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
NO METAL IS PUT TOUCHING THOSE TWO WIRES AND LIKE THAT AND CONNECT STILL JUST READY TO GET THE (*)
<SIDE SPEECH> BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS ELECTRICITY IN IT SO WHEN THEN TWO CONNECTERS CONNECT TO THE METAL FIND ON BOTH SIDES AS THE SWITCH TOUCHES METAL THEN IT WILL START WORKING AND CREATE AND PUT IT WOULD ELECTRICITY TO THE FLAG
<SIDE SPEECH> THOSE ARE ALSO THAT ELECTRICITY SO WHEN YOU PUT TWO WIRES ON THEY AND PUT A SET TO A D CELL AND PUTTING INTO SUN THEN (*) VIBRATING TO BE LIKE (*) THAT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THAT CELL
THE ELECTRICITY WILL GO THROUGH THE D CELL AND IT WILL TURN ON THE FLAG
NO NAIL
IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL
ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT TO MAKE IT MOVE
<SIDE SPEECH> THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY
IT’S ON THE METAL WHERE THE WIRE IS SO IT DOESN’T COUNT ALL THE WAY BUT IT GOES ON LIKE (*) SO THERE JUST IT IS ELECTRICITY PASS THERE SO THEY WAS ON TOP WHAT A PRETTY AS MUCH ELECTRICITY
< SIDE SPEECH> IT’S NOT GOING TO TILL BECAUSE THE SWITCHES OFF AND IT’S NOT CREATING A CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE FLAG MOVE
<SIDE SPEECH> NO
THE FLAG STOPS MOVING BECAUSE IT DOES THE SUNLIGHT AND IT IS HAVE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN THE WIRES
<SIDE SPEECH> THE D CELL IS AT A CIRCUIT <SIDE SPEAKERS> (*)
<SIDE SPEECH> THE SWITCH HAS TO BE ON
THEN IT DOESN’T WORK
<SIDE SPEECH> IT’S NOT TOUCHING METAL SO WHERE ELECTRICITY WON’T GO TO THE FLAG AND IT WILL MAKE A CIRCUIT
<SIDE SPEECH> THE D CELL HAS TO BE ATTRACTED TWO WIRES TO GO THROUGH THE ELECTRICITY TO GET TO THE MOVE
IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
BECAUSE THERE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONCE
I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
IT WORKS BECAUSE IT’S A METAL
<SIDE_SPEECH> ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO THROUGH THE NAIL
<NOISE> BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS METAL SO THAT’S METAL SO IT'S MAKE IN A WORK
(*) ONE +HM+ THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SO I ALREADY KNOW THAT
ITS OPEN
<SIDE_SPEECH>  INSULATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT METAL <SIDE_SPEECH> BUT +HUM+ CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS ARE METAL THAT MAKES JUST SITTING
<SIDE_SPEECH> YEAH I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU <SIDE_SPEECH> I KNOW YOU WE MET BEFORE BUT NO I DON'T WANT TO MEET YOU
WE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE
IT'S NOT GOING BECAUSE <SIDE_SPEECH> IF THAT'S NOT METAL THEN(*) WORK
METAL IS SOMETHING IF SOMETHING'S METAL THEN AND IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ALL SIDES METAL THEN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLETE CONDUCTOR
JUST DRAW THE TAPE THE SPIRAL THAT ROCK IN STUFF ARE ALL INSULATORS BUT A OTHER STUFF IS CONDUCTORS
ALL THE OBJECTS WILL NOT MAKE ELECTRICITY GO
<NOISE>THE NAIL
ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT OKAY
<NOISE> YOU'RE SEPARATE NO AND THERE ITS IT'S LIKE WE BETTER SO YEAH
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE (*) YOU CAN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT
<NOISE> I TALK TO YOU LATER BYE
AND FINNALY MET BEFORE
<SIDE_SPEECH> YOUR DOWN
I DON'T KNOW
<SIDE_SPEECH> ITS FLOWING THROUGH ELECTRICITY
<NOISE>
<NOISE>
<NOISE>
<NOISE>
USE THEIR STRAWS AND YOU MIGHT'VE USED DIFFERENT STRAWS
TO MEASURE THINGS
SO YOU KNOW HOW LONG <FP> IT WOULD BE INSTEAD OF JUST GUESSING AND IT WOULD MAYBE <FP> SOME PEOPLE GOT IT RIGHT AND PEOPLE GOT IT WRONG AND YOU WOULD <BREATH> MAYBE YOU WOULD UM <BREATH> GET DIFFERENT LENGTHS AND BE HARD TO MAKE HOUSES AND BUILDINGS
YOU <BREATH> YOU WOULD PUT THE ZERO ON THE EDGE AND SEE HOW LONG IT WOULD GO TIL YOU HIT THE OTHER EDGE OF THE PAPER
I KNOW IT'S A HUNDRED A HUNDREDTH OF A CENTIMETER
OKAY THAT IT WAS TEN S CENTIMETERS LONG
YOU WOULD KNOW HOW LONG IT WA UH WOULD BE
WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WE'VE BEEN <FP> DOING MEASUREMENT AND WE'VE BEEN MEASURING WITH STRAWS
THAT WOULD BE PRETTY BAD
BE ABOUT THAT BIG AND GROUP A WOULD BE SU
SAME LENGTH SO IT WOULD BE EASIER
NO WE ALL HAD THE SAME BUT <BREATH> IF YOU MEASURED WITH STRAWS MAYBE SOMEONE WILL WOULD U MAYBE YOU WOULD SAY I WANT M MY BACKBOARD TO MY BED TEN STRAWS HIGH AND THE OTHER PERSON MIGHT DO IT
N MMM
THAT A RULER WOULD BE EASIER TO USE
A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS ARE IN A METER
TOLD Y
RUL- <FP> MOST RULE MOST RULERS ARE THE SAME
A METER TAPE I MEAN THE METER STICK WOULD PROBABLY BE EASIER TO ALSO REALLY EASY TO USE BECAUSE ALL MY DAD'S ARE THE SAME LENGTH
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL A METER INSTEAD OF LIKE A S A KILOMETER <BREATH>
MY DAD MEASURED WI- UM BUILDS BUILDINGS SO HE USES A LOT OF THIS STUFF
A METER TAPE
YEAH <FP> ONE WOULD BE SMALLER AND ONE WOULD BE S HUGE
BECAUSE THE TAPE WOULD'VE UM MARKED THE SPOT
WITH A RULER OR TAPE MEASURE
IT'S IT'S LIKE A TAPE MEASURER BUT INSTEAD OF USING INCHES YOU WOULDN'T USE M ME METERS
BECAUSE THE ARD <FP> BECAUSE THE TAPE
<BREATH> WELL WE WERE TRYING TO UM TRYING TO DECIDE IF IT WAS A GOOD THING TO MEASURE WITH AND WE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT GOOD TO MEASURE WITH BECAUSE THERE IS DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF STRAWS
A METER STICK
WE GUESSED FIRST AND THEN WE AND THEN MISS WA MISS WAGNER PUT
WE WERE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT ONE WAS HEAVIEST AND FINDING OUT IF IT IF IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO USE TO F TRY TO FIND UM WHAT THINGS
IT PROBABLY IT WOULDN'T IT THE NUMBER WOULDN'T BE LOWER OR HIGHER IT WOULD BE JUST RIGHT SO IT'D BE EASIER
N MMM
BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T GET THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF APPLES OR YOU WOULD GET CONFUSED SO IT ISN'T THAT SO YOU SHOULDN'T MEASURE WITH PAPER I MEAN WEIGH IN WITH PAPER CLIPS
BECAUSE IF YOU CAME UP AND SAID TO A CARPENTER
N MMM
N
WE WE WEN AND <BREATH> W WE WENT AND GOT PAPER CLIPS TO SEE HOW MUCH THEY WOULD WEIGH SO FIRST WE DID THE PLASTIC CHIP
M YEAH METAL WASHER A AND THE METAL WASHER WAS THE HEAVIEST AND THE BLOCK I MEAN THE WOOD SQUARE WAS THE LIGHTEST
E IT WOULD BE HARDER TO USE PAPER CLIPS BECAUSE YOU WOULD KEEP ON GETTING MIXED UP
WE JUST STARTED IT ON THE UM UNIT ON FRIDAY
WA
MMM HMM MMM BALANCE
<FP> I WANT <BREATH> I MEAN IF YOU CAME UP TO SOMEONE WHO WORKED AT A GROCERY STORE AND SAID YOU WANTED
SOME PAPER CLIPS AREN'T THE SAME SIZE AND SOMETHING LIKE POUNDS EASILY WEIGH THE S ARE U WEIGH THE SAME ALWAYS AND PAPER CLIPS THERE COULD BE BIG SIZES AND SMALL SIZES SO
UH THE METAL WASHER WITH THE PLASTIC CHIP TO SEE IF THEY TO SEE WHAT ONE WAS HEAVIER AND THE METAL WASHER WAS
POUNDS AND THAT STUFF
PAPER CLIPS THEN
NINE PAPER CLIPS
N SO IT SAY ONE POUND IT W YOU WANTED ONE POUND OF SOMETHING
AND OUR GROUP SAID THAT IT'S WE SHOULDN'T MEASURE WITH THE I MEAN WEIGH THE IT'S NOT A GOOD WAY TO WEIGH
OF APPLES PROBABLY A HE YOU PROBABLY WOULD'VE USED SMALL AND HE COULDA USED BIG
GOOD TO USE FOR MEASURE I MEAN <FP> WEIGHT
IT WAS ABOUT
STUFF WITH <FP> THE BLO- THE WOOD BECAUSE SOME MIGHT WEIGH DIFFERENT KIND I MEAN DIFFERENT POUNDS DIFFERENT AMOUNTS
MMM HMM Y YEAH
PLASTIC I MEAN UM NO NOT THE CHIP WAS SECOND HEAVIEST AND THE S SQUARE OF WOOD WAS THE LIGHTEST
MMM SINCE <FP> A PO ONE POUND WEIGHS YOU CAN'T THERE'S NO THERE'S NO BIGGER POUNDS AND NO SMALLER POUNDS SO IT'D BE EASIER
WE WEIGHED IN THREE THINGS AND WE FOUND OUT THAT WE WEIGHED IN A BLOCK O A LITTLE SQUARE WOOD PLASTIC CHIP AND A
AND
N MMM
<FP> WE DIDN'T GET ALL THE S UM WE DIDN'T GET THE SAME ANSWERS BECAUSE SOME OF THE PAPER CLIPS WERE BIGGER AND SOME OF EM WERE SMALLER AND WE FOUND OUT THAT YOU SHOULDN'T WEIGH STUFF WITH PAPER CLIPS EITHER
THE ONE THAT WENT UP WENT LOWER WAS THE ONE THAT'S HEAVIER
IT WAS ABOUT
AND PLASTIC CHIPS AND WOOD SQUARE AND <FP> THEY DIDN'T WEIGH THE SAME
UM YEAH IT THINK THEY ARE BOTH ON BUT UM THE BATTERY CAN'T GIVE AS MUCH POWER TO BOTH OF THEM UM IT CAN ONLY GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF POWER SO THEY'RE DULLER THEY'RE NOT AS BRIGHT AS THE ONE WITH TWO BATTERIES WHERE THEY GET A LOT BRIGHTER
THE ONE LIGHTBULB WAS OFF UM IT IT WAS JUST ONE WIRE THAT WAS CONNECTING FROM ONE BATTERY UM SO IT WAS GOING THROUGH UM TO THAT ONE LIGHTBULB AND NOT TO THE OTHER
WE USED TWO BATTERIES BUT THEY HAD TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE BECAUSE IF ONE IF ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH UM A CIRCUIT AND IF IT'S COMING FROM A PLUS IF IT'S COMING FROM A POSITIVE THROUGH UM ANOTHER POSITIVE IT CAN'T UM GO THROUGH SO WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THE BATTERIES WHERE FLIPPED AROUND RIGHT AND WE ALSO HAD TO USE TWO BATTERIES BECAUSE UM WE HAD CAUSE THE LIGHTBULB WOULDN'T LIGHT THE LIGHTBULBS WOULDN'T LIGHT UP VERY BRIGHTLY CAUSE AL THERE WOULDN'T BE AS MUCH POWER NOT THERE WOULD BE BARELY ENOUGH POWER TO LIGHT BOTH OF THEM UP WITH ONLY ONE BATTERY
GOOD
CAN I SEE IT WHEN THEY'RE ON AGAIN
YEAH IT COULD THERE COULD BE A WIRE IN BETWEEN THE TWO THINGS AND IT WOULD ACT IT WOULD BE THERE COULD BE A WIRE IN BETWEEN THE TWO BATTERIES AND IT WOULD ACT THE SAME AS IF THEY WERE TOUCHING EACH OTHER
OH UM IF THE NEGATIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE ARE TO ARE UM FACING SO THE NEGATIVE CAN'T GO THROUGH UM WITH ANOTHER NEGATIVE JUST LIKE A POSITIVE CAN'T GO THROUGH WITH ANOTHER POSITIVE SO UM IT CAN'T LET THE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH IT HAS TO BE A PLUS AND A MINUS
EVERYTHING STAYED THE SAME IT DIDN'T LIKE TAKE A WIRE OUT OR ANYTHING AND I CAN'T SEE A SWITCH SO I DON'T KNOW
THERE WERE THREE LIGHTS THEN UM THE BATTERIES WOULD KIND OF BE LIKE ONE FOR TWO LIGHTS THEY WOULDN'T WORK AS WELL
WE'VE IN UM WE'VE BEEN DOING WELL WE'RE TRYING TO LIGHT TWO LIGHTBULBS IN ONE CIRCUIT NOW SO WE ARE TRYING TO LIGHT THEM WITH BATTERY UM AND USE ONE BATTERY AND MAKE AND YOU JUST USE ONE CIRCUIT
MOVE ON
YEAH WE WOULD NEED ONE MORE BATTERY I THINK
WELL IT WAS OFF
WHEN I CLICKED ON IT IT WAS ON BUT WHEN I CLICKED ON IT AND UM AT THE BEGINNING UH WHEN THERE WASN'T A D CELL THEN UM IT WAS OFF ONE OF THEM WAS OFF
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE DID TODAY WE WOULD HAVE THE WIRE IN BETWEEN THE TWO WELL IT THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRE SO THE UM THERE'S ONE BATTERY AND THEN THEN THERE'S A WIRE IN BETWEEN IT AND THERE'S ANOTHER BATTERY THAT UM AND IT'LL GO THROUGH BUT JUST LIKE UM IF THE BATTERIES TOUCHING EACH OTHER AND IT'LL GO AROUND AND LIGHT UP EACH LIGHT BULB
THE BATTERY IS POWERING BOTH LIGHT BULBS THE BATTERY IS UM GO THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY IS GOING THROUGH THE UM THROUGH THE WIRES AND IT'S GETTING AND IT'S ABLE TO GET THROUGH INTO THE LIGHTBULB AND THEN GO TO THE NEXT LIGHTBULB IN BETWEEN THE A W THE WIRE THAT'S CONNECTING THE TWO OTHER LIGHTBULBS AND UM THEN IT'S COMING DOWN INTO THE BATTERY OFF THE OTHER SIDE
THE BATTERIES ARE ACTING AS ONE WITH UM THEY'RE CONNECTED BASICALLY SO AND UM IT'S ON ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY IT'S GOING UP TO INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND IT'S LIGHTING THE LIGHTBULB UP BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE IT'S JUST GOING THROUGH TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY
THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE UM AND THE LITTLE WIRE THE LITTLE BARE PART OF THE WIRE IS CONNECTING WITH THE WIRE INSIDE THE LIGHTBULB AND UM IT'S GOING UP AND LETTING THE ELEC- THE ENERGY LIGHT IT UP
THE BATTERIES HAD TO BE FLIPPED AROUND RIGHT BECAUSE IF IT WAS A POSITIVE SIDE GOING TO ANOTHER POSITIVE SIDE IT WOULDN'T WORK OUT IT WOULDN'T LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH BUT IF IT'S A NEGATIVE SIDE TO A POSITIVE SIDE YOU CAN LET IT FLOW THROUGH
WHEN THE WE
THE POSITIVE SIDE IS FACING THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THEY'RE TOUCHING EACH OTHER THEN THEY'RE ABLE TO CONNECT TO EACH SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO CONNECTING THEM TOGETHER UM BUT IT'S JUST THEY'RE TOUCHING EACH OTHER AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDES IT'S ABLE TO USE AND IT PROBABLY GIVES MORE POWER
YEAH THEY TURN OFF
I'M NOT SURE
ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES AND LIGHTS UP THE LIGHT BULB
YOU HAVE TO PUT UM WIRES ON TWO BATTERIES TO MAKE IT WORK BECAUSE WELL IT DOES NOT EXACTLY NOT BUT UM IT WORKS BETTER WITH TWO BATTERIES BECAUSE WITH UM OUT TWO BATTERIES IT'S REALLY MUCH HARDER BECAUSE THEY BARELY LIGHT UP AND YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHEN THEY'RE SO WE HAD TO UM GET WE HAD TO PUT A WIRE IN BETWEEN THE TWO LIGHTBULBS UM AND ONE ON EACH SIDE OF ONE OF THE LIGHTBULBS ON THE OUTSIDE OF EACH LIGHTBULB AND THAT WOULD GO ONTO ONE OF THE OTHER BATTERIES AND THE OTHER BATTERIES B WOULD BE AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY WOULD BE CONNECTED TO UM A SWITCH AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE OF UH BATTERY WOULD BE CONNECTED TO A SWITCH
I THOUGHT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS
MAYBE SOMETIMES YOU COULD UH USE THAT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND YOUR HORSESHOE OR SOMETHING YOU COULD BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN I PLAY AT THE BEACH UM <BREATH> W SOMETIMES WE BRING OUR HORSESHOES TO WYOMING AND IT WOULD BE REALLY COOL IF WE COULD COME UP WITH A HUGE MAGNET THAT WOULD KIND OF <BREATH> HELP STICK UM THE THAT WOULD HELP GET THE HORSESHOE FIND IT BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETIC <BREATH> FORCE THAT WOULD PULL THE HORSESHOE TOWARD UM US SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO LOSE EM IN THE SAND AGAIN
IT UM <BREATH> I REMEMBER ACTUALLY LEARNING THAT TOO I JUST FORGOT TO SAY THAT THAT'S THE TEMPORARY MAGNET BECAUSE IF YOU RUB IT UM IT BECOMES A TEMPORARY MAGNET CAUSE THAT MAGNETISM KIND OF I THINK IT GOES INTO THE <BREATH> IRON AND IT KIND OF KEEPS IT FOR A LITTLE TINY BIT AND THEN IT'LL <BREATH> DROP AFTER AFTER A WHILE SO THE INDUCED MAGNETISM WAS DIFFERENT UM BECAUSE IT HAD IT JUST IT MADE THE M THE MAGNET STICK THE MAGNET <BREATH> UM WOULD S MAKE IT WOULD MAKE THE PAPER CLIP STICK WHEN THE MAGNET WAS ON THE NAIL EVEN THOUGH THE PAPER CLIP WASN'T STICKING TO THE NAIL UM EVEN THOUGH THE PAPER CLIP WASN'T STICKING TOUCHING THE MAGNET <BREATH> AND THAT A TEMPORARY MAGNET YOU JUST HAD TO RUB THE MAGNET ONTO THE NAIL AND IT WOULD MAKE IT SO THAT THE PA SO THAT THE PAPER CLIP WOULD S UM STICK WITHOUT THE MAGNET EVEN TOUCHING THE NAIL
THAT THE METAL THAT THE IRON WAS PULLED UM BY THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM THE MAGNET <BREATH> IT WHEN SO IT BECAME A TEMPORARY MAGNET THAT JUST PULLED IT AND <BREATH> UM ALSO S WHEN IF YOU USE MAGNETS ON A PENCIL YOU COU IF YOU PUT A NEGATIVE SIDE AGAINST A POSITIVE SIDE IT'LL BOUNCE AROUND SO THERE'S ANOTHER MAGNETIC FORCE THAT YOU CAN USE
THANKS I HAD A GREAT TIME
UM THEY WHEN YOU PUT SOMETHING AROUND A MAGNETIC FIELD UM AND IF YOU PUT IRON AROUND A MAGNETIC FIELD <BREATH> AND IT'S UM ON A POSITIVE SIDE OR S THEN IT WILL STICK TO IT WILL BECOME A TEMPORARY MAGNET FOR AS LONG <BREATH> AS IT IS STUCK TO THE MAGNET AS THE IRON IS STUCK TO THE AS THE IRON IS NEAR THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT WILL STICK AND THEN THAT'S KIND OF BEING LIKE TWO MAGNETS WITH A POSITIVE AND A NEGATIVE SIDE TOGETHER
WELL WE DIDN'T USE MAGNETS SO THEY COULDN'T PUSH EACH OTHER AWAY BUT UM IT WAS KIND OF BUT WE DIDN'T USE ANOTHER MAGNET NOT REALLY BECAUSE WELL WE WE USED MORE IRON UM TO FIND THE MAGNETS MORE THAN OTHER MAGNETS CAUSE WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO USE ANOTHER MAGNET CAUSE IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT EASIER AND WE WOULDN'T FIND OUT WHAT IN THAT BAG THAT WE HAD HAD IRON IN I
IT WAS MORE OF THE METAL THINGS UM AND SOMETIMES THE COMPASS BUT THE COMPASS SOMETIMES DIDN'T WORK IT WOULD JUST GO ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND BECAUSE <BREATH> WE PUT TWO UM MAGNETS IN A BOX SO IT DIDN'T REALLY HELP SOMETIMES BUT THE METAL WOULD ALWAYS JUST STAY THERE AND IT WOULD BE HARD TO GET IT OFF SO IT WAS EASIER WITH THE METAL WELL THE IRON I MEAN <BREATH> UM BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME THINGS THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT MAGNETS ABOUT HOW THEY CAN TAKE MEMORIES OFF OF THINGS SO KEEP IT AWAY FROM YOUR CREDIT CARDS AND UM THAT STUFF BECAUSE IT CAN WIPE OUT THE MEMORY AND THEN THAT'S ALL YOUR MONEY GONE THAT A LOT OF YOUR MONEY GONE SO
UM IT USE IT IT USES UM IT TO MAKE <BREATH> THE IRON A TEMPORARY MAGNET AGAINST IT <BREATH> AND UM
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS BECA- AND WE'VE BEEN SEEING WHAT STICKS TO THEM AND RECENTLY LEAR WE LEARNED ABOUT UM <BREATH> THAT MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO THINGS WITH IRON AND WE HAD TODAY WE DID THIS ONE THING WHERE WE WOULD PUT MAGNETS IN THIS CARDBOARD BOX WE WOULD TAPE EM WITH WE WOULD TAPE EM DOWN AND WE WOULD THEN WE WOULD <BREATH> TRY TO WE'D EACH GET A BAG AND WE WOULD TRY TO FIND WHAT <FP> WHERE THE PEOPLE HID WHERE THE OTHER PEOPLE HAD HID THE MAGNET IN UM THE BOX WITH OTHER IRON THINGS <BREATH> WE USED WASHERS AND PAPER CLIPS AND COMPASSES WERE ACTUALLY REALLY HELPFUL CAUSE THEY'RE <BREATH> POINTER UM THING THEY'RE MADE <FP> POINTED IT TO UM WH- THE MAG WHERE THE MAGNET WAS SINCE IT WAS MADE OUT OF IRON <BREATH> SO IT WAS REALLY COOL UM TO TRY TO FIND ALL THE OTHER BOXES AND WE HAD TO DO A SHEET AND TELL THINGS ABOUT WHY WE AND ABOUT HOW WE FOUND THE <BREATH> MAGNETS AND THAT STUFF
YES
I THINK THAT THE MAGNET <BREATH> IS SENDING THE ME THE MAGNET WILL SEND UM THE MAGNETIC IT WILL GO THROUGH THE NAIL AND IT WILL AND IT WILL STICK TO THE <BREATH> PAPER CLIP AND THAT IS A TEMPORARY MAGNET WHEN THE NAIL IS WHEN I SO THE THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL SO THE NAIL IS NOW A TEMPORARY MAGNET WHERE IT WILL SO IT WILL TAKE IRON THINGS AND IT WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD THEM
FIND IT IN RAILROAD TRACKS UH WELL THEY'RE TRYING TO CA WELL THEY CAME UP WITH THIS TRAIN <BREATH> WHERE YOU YOU CAN HAVE THIS ONE MAGNET WITH THE NEGATIVE SIDE FACING UM ON A TRAIN WITH A POSITIVE SIDE AND IT WILL MOVE ALONG THE TRAIN TRACKS WITHOUT TOUCHING THE GROUND <BREATH> AND UM YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THAT MAGNETIC FORCE BUT YOU WELL YOU CAN BUT UM YOU CAN'T SEE THE ENERGY GOING TOWARD YOU CAN'T SEE THE ENERGY CONNECTING WITH THEM TO PUSH EACH OTHER AWAY BUT YOU CAN SEE UM A DIFFERENT KIND OF WHAT YOU CAN SEE THAT THE REACTION WHERE THE TRAIN IS GOING OFF THE TRAIN TRACKS INSTEAD OF <BREATH> LIKE A REGULAR TRAIN WHERE IT STAYS ON THE TRAIN TRACK AND JUST ROLLS BY THE WHEELS
YES
IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT'S A UH S IT L IT'S A CIRCUIT BUT IT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE A SQUARE RIGHT NOW
I'M GOOD THANKS
THERE'S STILL A S
THE ELECTRI- THAT WHATEVER'S IN HERE IS THIS A LIGHT BULB AT TH
IT DID
LIGHT BULB
THERE WERE T THERE WAS I'M NOT SURE CAUSE THE WIRES WAS CONNECTED IT EITHER WENT THROUGH CAUSE THERE WAS TAPE ON THE SIDES <BREATH> SO YOU COULDN'T REALLY SEE <BREATH> OR UM IT EITHER WAS TWO WIRES COMING AROUND OR JUST ONE WIRE GOING ALL THE WAY THROUGH AROUND
THE BATTERY THE BATTERY CARRIES ELECTRICITY AND IT WELL WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
YOU PUT THE BATTERY INTO THE PLACE RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER AND THEN YOU WOULD HA
ELECTRICITY IS GETTING CARRIED THROUGH THE WIRE AND UP INTO THE AND UP INTO THE <BREATH> WIRES WHERE IT IT WHERE THE LIGHT BULB GETS WELL THE WIRE IS GETTING CONNECTED UM TO THE THE WIRE'S GETTING CONNECTED TO THE WIRE INSIDE THE LIGHT BULB <BREATH> AND THE BLUE THINGS I THINK ARE ELECTRICITY AND THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING UP THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND KEEPING IT LIT
IT GOES FROM THE SIDES OF THE BATTERY WHERE IT K WHERE THE ELECTRICITY CAN GO UM OUT OF THE BATTERY AND ONTO THE WIRES AND THEN IT GOES AROUND AND INTO THE MOTOR SO IT UM THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS IN A CIRCUIT <BREATH> AND UM IT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES AND ONTO THE MOTOR WHICH MAKES IT RUN
WE HAVE MOST RECENTLY WHICH WAS TODAY WE HAVE BEEN <BREATH> DOING ELECTRICITY WE LIT UP UM A <BREATH> LIGHT BULB AND A MOTOR FIRST WE DID THE MOTOR THE MOTOR WAS <BREATH> SOMETHING WHERE WE USED WIRES AND WE TU AND WE TOOK UM THE BARE PART OF THE WIRE CAUSE THE REST OF THE WIRE WAS WRAPPED IN RUBBER <BREATH> AND WE PUT THE BARE PART OF THE WIRE ONTO THE BATTERY AND UM THEN <BREATH> WE STUCK THE OTHER SIDE WHERE THE OTHER BARE PART WAS ONTO THE MOT <FP> OR WELL NO WE HA WE IT WAS ALREADY STUCK TO THE MOTOR WE JUST HAD TO PUT <BREATH> THE TWO OTHER SIDES ONTO THE BATTERY AND IT RAN
THAT IS UM <BREATH> THE ON AND OFF SWITCH THE THING THAT IS UNCONNECTED BECAUSE <BREATH> THE ELECTRICITY IF THAT MOTOR IS NOT IF THAT SWITCH IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE THING THE ELECTRICITY CANNOT FLOW THROUGH <BREATH> IT WILL NOT UM GO THROUGH THE WIRES AND CONNECT ONTO THE MOTOR BECAUSE <BREATH> IT IT IS IT WILL GO OUT AND IT WILL NOT HIT THE OTHER WIRE SO THAT'S KIND OF LIKE AN ON AND OFF SWITCH <BREATH> SO IT'S PRETTY COOL
THAT IS THE SECOND THING WE DID IN SCIENCE WHERE WE USED UM THE BATTERY TO GO AROUND LIKE THAT INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB
OU MEAN ABOUT LET'S START WITH IT
SO THE BATTERY GETS INSI- INSIDE THE TWO THINGS AND THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH INTO THE LIGHT BULB
THE SWITCH UM WILL TAKE THE WIRES AND IT WILL TURN THEM OFF BECAUSE IF WHEN THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH IT IT'LL FLOW THROUGH THE METAL AND IF IT DOESN'T TOUCH THE OTHER CONNECTED THING THEN IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH AND MA AND LIGHT UP THE AND MAKE THE MOTOR GO ROUND AND ROUND
YES
I SEE THAT
TER NEXT TO IT WHERE THE RIGHT ON THE RIGHT HAND BOTTOM *CORNER* <BREATH> CORNER NO WAIT NO THE BATTER NO THEN YOU WOULD PUT THE MOTOR RIGHT UM WHERE THE ON THE RIGHT HAND BOTTOM CORNER AND THEN YOU WOULD PUT THE SWITCH ON THE TWO LITTLE THINGS IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN THE WIRE WOULD GO UM AROUND AND IT WOULD TOUCH THE TWO SWITCH PLACES WHERE IT HAS THOSE LITTLE THINGS WHERE THE WIRE GOES IN <BREATH> THEN THE MOTOR AND IT WOULD HAVE THE WIRE AND THE MOTOR AND IT WOULD HAVE THE WIRE TOUCHING THE BATTERIES AND
YEAH
THAT'S WHY IT'S KIND OF LIKE AN ON AND OFF SWITCH BECAUSE IF YOU CONNECT THE SWITCH TO THE OTHER WIRE THEN THE ELECTRICITY IS ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH <BREATH> AND IT WILL TURN ON THE MOTOR BUT WHEN IT'S NOT THEN IT'S NOT CONNECTED AND IT WON'T BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE WHERE IT GETS CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR
THE MOTOR UM HAD THE WIRE THE
A CIRCUIT IS UM THE WAY THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS AND IT'S ALSO KIND OF IT'S GOT IT GOT ITS NAME FROM THE WORD CIRCLE <BREATH> IT'S THE WAY THINGS FLOW LIKE IN UM YOU WOULD D IT IT'S ALSO GOT OTHER THINGS THAT YOU CAN USE FOR LIKE IN THE DAY IF YOU DID SOMETHING THE SAME IT WOULD GO IT WOULD MOVE IN A AND WELL IF IT STARTED OUT WITH ONE THING AND ENDED WITH THAT ONE THING AND ALL THE SAME THINGS <BREATH> WENT TO THE I DON'T KNOW BUT IT UM MOVES IN A CIRCLE AROU- AROUND THE FLYER AND THAT KINDA WHAT A CIRCUIT MEANS
WE HAD TO HAVE THE WIRE UM ON THE BATTERY
NO
THE MOTOR HAD A LITTLE FLAG ON IT AND UM WHEN WHEN YOU HAD IT CONNECTED UPRIGHT IT SPUN
WE DID
THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING AND LETTING THE MOTOR RUN
YEAH
ON EACH SIDE OF THE BATTERY WE HAD TO PUT THE BARE PA THE BARE PART OF THE WIRE WHERE IT'S SILVER NOT ON THE OTHER PLACES BECAUSE IF IT WAS ON THE OTHER PLACES THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK IT HAD TO BE WHERE THE ENERGY COMES OUT <BREATH> THE ENERGY FROM THE WIRES WAS ELECTRICITY AND IT CAME THROUGH THE WIRES AND ONTO THE MOTOR AND IN AND WHEN IT HIT INSIDE THE MOTOR IT SPUN AROUND THE FLAG SPUN AROUND REALLY FAST
CLICK THE PICTURE
NO
I THINK SO
YES
MMM HMM YEAH UH-HUH YEP
YEAH I GUESS
YEAH
WELL IF SHE'S LIKE UM WHAT SCIENCE WHAT SCIENCE PEOPLE DO USE SO BECAUSE IF WE JUST USE THE CUP THOSE PROBABLY WOULD JUST SPILL OUT AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE SPILL OUT TOO SO
YEAH <BREATH> CAUSE I DON'T REALLY THINK YOU COULD PUT THE TOP IN THERE ANYWAYS
NO NOT REALLY IT WAS IT WAS UM <FP> JUST LIKE UM SEVEN UP BOTTLES NOT CANS BUT BOTTLES LIKE THE BO THE BIG BOTTLES YEAH
YEAH ONE MILLILITER
WELL THIS IS ONE MILLILITER THIS IS ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND THIS IS LIKE A THOUSAND SO YOU CAN LIKE SEE THE HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM
TWO HUNDRED
OH BECAUSE THEN YOU YOU CAN'T LIKE ESTIMATE BECAUSE THEN YOU CA LIKE IF ONE PERSON ESTIMATES HOW BIG THEIR BOTTLE WOULD BE EVERYONE WOULD ESTIMATE THE SAME EXACT THING BECAUSE THE BOTTLE'S THE SAME EXACT SIZE <BREATH> AND <FP> THEN LIKE IF ONE PERSON'S WRONG CAUSE SO THEN IF ONE PERSON UM ESTIMATES AND IT'S WRONG WELL IT DOESN'T REALLY M WELL WELL JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU WANNA HAVE LIKE DIFFERENT ANSWERS TO IT <BREATH> T AND
<BREATH> YES NO IT DOESN'T LOOK THE SAME BUT IT IS THE SAME <BREATH> BECAUSE IT'S JUST THAT THIS IS MORE TALLER AND THIS IS MORE WIDER BUT IF YOU LIKE IF YOU LIKE SHRUNK THIS INTO THAT IT WOULD BE THE SAME
WELL MAYBE YOU COULD PICK BOTH OF EM UP AT THE SAME TIME AND THEN THAT AND THEN YOU COULD LIKE WEIGH SORTA OR YOU COULD USE A SCALE WITH THE FULCRUM AND THE BALANCE AND THE BASE <BREATH> AND YOU COULD JUST PUT THOSE ON ONE SIDE BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SCIENTIFIC LIKE NOT WITH THE CUPS OR ANYTHING <BREATH> SO I WOULD PUT THOSE ON ONE SIDE AND THEN THAT ON THE OTHER <FP> YOU WOULD WAIT TIL IT LEVELED OUT AND IT WOULD PROBABLY BE PRETTY BY TO THE SAME
REALLY <FP> YEAH
YEAH WE USED THE SYRINGE AND WE JUST FILLED IT UP TO LIKE TEN OR FIVE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH WATER HOW MUCH WATER WAS IN IT WAS IN THE BOTTLE <BREATH> S AND <BREATH> SO YEAH YEP MMM NOT REALLY NOT REALLY
WELL WE COULD BECAUSE WE LOOKED AT THE WATER LEVEL SO WHEN IT WAS LIKE BY TO THE TOP LIKE THIS WOULD BE THE TOP OF IT AND SO WE AND THIS IS THE WATER POINT SO WE WOULD S SO IF IT'S THIS HIGH WE WOULD KNOW LIKE PROBABLY TEN TEN MO TEN MORE YEAH
YEAH
BECAUSE IF YOU WANNA FILL IT UP TO LIKE THE FIFTY YOU'D LOOK AT THE LINES AND AND YOU'D PULL IT UP UNTIL IT AND UNTIL IT MATCHES UP WITH THE FIFTY THE THE UM THIS BOTTOM PART
I DON'T THINK I WOULD USE LIKE A SYRINGE <BREATH> WELL I MIGHT USE A SYRINGE I MIGHT USE A SYRINGE BUT IT I THINK IT WOULD TAKE A WHILE SO TO FILL UP THAT I'D PROBABLY USE LIKE A CUP A CUP SO JUST GET THE WATER DUMP IT IN GET THE WATER DUMP IT IN <BREATH>
UH ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS FILLS UP THAT
YEAH BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S A HUNDRED SO YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE RIGHT THERE BUT YOU'D HAVE TO DO IT TEN TIMES SO YEAH
OH YEAH <LAUGH> ALRIGHT <BREATH> WELL SO MISS GATES MY TEACHER SHE GAVE UM ME A UM THE CLASSMATES DIFFERENT TYPES OF BOTTLES AND AND UM WE HAD LIKE UH GLASSES OF WATER AND UM SO WE WOULD TR- WE WOULD FILL THE WE WOULD FILL THE UM BOTTLE TO THE TOP AND WE WOULD COUNT HOW MUCH HOW MUCH WE HAD HOW MU IN A LI BECAUSE WE WOULD USE I FORGET WHAT IT'S CALLED I FORGET WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT UM YOU YOU HAVE TO SUCK IN THE WATER YES A SYRINGE <BREATH> AND THEN YOU HAVE TO AND SO <BREATH>
IT'D PROBABLY BE THAT ONE BECAUSE AT THAT IT MIGHT THAT IT MIGHT MEAN WELL BECAUSE YOU JUST HAVE TO LINE IT UP SORTA YOU CAN'T IT CAN'T BE OVER AND IT CAN'T BE UNDER A LITTLE <BREATH> WELL BECAUSE UM IT SO M THERE'S SO MUCH PRESSURE THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY YOU JUST LET IT'S JUST HA MORE HARDER BUT WHEN YOU GET USED TO IT YOU SORT OF KNOW HOW HEAVY IT'S GONNA BE LIKE AT FIRST YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S GONNA BE LIKE REAL LIGHT SO WHEN YOU TRY TO SO YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO PULL LIGHT BUT IT'S GONNA BE REALLY HARD <BREATH> BUT THEN ONCE <FP> BUT THEN ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT YOU LIKE KNOW HOW HEAVY OR HOW HOW HARD IT'S GONNA PULL
NOT ALL THE WAY NOT ALL THE WAY
MMM NOT REALLY CAUSE WE ALL HAD DIFFERENT BOTTLES EVERY GROUP SO NOT REALLY MMM HMM
UM I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY TIMES BUT <BREATH>
THE LAST ONE
HUH WELL THEN PROBABLY HAVE THE SAME THING TWICE
YEAH IT SORTA WAS
N MMM NOT REALLY <LAUGH>
WELL BECAU- WE HAD A THOUSAND TEN BUT WE ALSO HAD THIS UM CUP THAT WAS A HUNDRED SO WE USED THAT TOO SO I SORTA YOU KNOW
SO LIKE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MEASURE HOW MUCH THERE'S IN ONE BOTTLE BUT YOU ALREADY BUT YOU DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THERE'S BECAUSE YOU AL BECAUSE YOU USED A DIFFERENT BOTTLE TO DO THE TO DO THE THING <BREATH> B SO IT'S JUST BETTER TO USE DIFFERENT SIZED
NO IT WAS IN THE CUPS AND THEN WE USED THE SYRINGE AND WE UM SQUIRTED IT IN THE BOTTLE AND WE WOULD COUNT HOW MUCH WAS IN IT AND THEN AT THE END WE WOUL- UM MISS GATES WOULD ASK US HOW MUCH IT TOOK AND MA OUR BOTTLE MY GROUP'S BOTTLE IT TOOK UM ONE THOUSAND TEN ONE THOUSAND TEN <FP> UM <BREATH> WELL BECAUSE THE BOTTLE IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY NUMBERS ON IT SO WE DIDN'T SO WE COULDN'T KNOW WHAT WHAT IF WE LIKE JUST FILLED THE BOTTLE WE WOULDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT WAS SO WE HAD TO USE THE SYRINGE TO TELL US SO ONE OF US WOULD KEEP SCORE AND UM WE WOULD LIKE TAKE TURNS PUTTING DOING THE SYRINGE SO YEAH AND WE COULD ONLY GO UP TO FIFTY WITH THE NUMBERS
NO THE WE'RE JUST THEY'RE JUST ESTIMATING BUT THEY WERE BY CAUSE THEY DID UM THE CAUSE THE THEY'RE THEY'RE UM ESTIMATE WAS BY BECAUSE IT WAS TWO HUNDRE- SOME TWO THOUSAND SOMETHING BUT I FORGET
THANKS
WELL BECAUSE UM WE'RE USING THE SYRINGE FOR LIKE THE FIRST UM TWENTY ONES BUT I BUT THEN WE FIGURED OUT IT WASN'T GOING ENOUGH SO <FP> A <FP> BUT THEN WE NOTICED WE HAD THE CUP WITH NUMBERS AND IT GOES UP TO A HUNDRED SO WE JUST WOULD FILL IT UP WITH THE WATER AND THEN DUMP IT IN SO IT WAS A HUNDRED <BREATH> UM IT WAS MORE QUICKER WAY MORE YEAH YEP
YEAH OUR GROUP ESTIMATED AND WE UM MOST OF US WELL MY TWO OTHER PARTNERS THEY SAID LIKE A HUNDRED FIFTY BUT YOU KNOW I WAS LIKE LOOKING AT THE SIZE CAUSE OUR CAUSE THE PEOPLE ACROSS FROM US <BREATH> THEIR BOTTLE WAS JUST LIKE A TINY BIT BIGGER THAN OURS AND THEY WERE LIKE ESTIMATING LIKE A THOUSAND SO I WAS SO YEAH SO SO THEN I SORT OF JUST SAID A THOUSAND
<BREATH> WELL BECAUSE THE IF YOU USE THE SAME SIZE EVERYONE WOULD HAVE THE SAME ANSWER BASICALLY UNLESS ONE'S WIDER
I THINK IT JUST IS TRYING TO TRICK US BUT Y YOU JUST DID THAT ONE YOU ALREADY DID THAT ONE
THE LINES WELL UM THEY THEY JUST TELL YOU HOW MUCH HOW FULL IT WOULD BE IT
WELL BECAUSE WE WANTED TO KEEP TRACK SO WE W SO WE WOULDN'T LIKE GET CONFUSED <BREATH> SO YEAH THAT'S
<LAUGH> MMM NO I DON'T THINK SO SO IT'S JUST SHOWING TEN TEN A HUNDREDS WOULD FIT IN A THOUSAND
SYRINGE <BREATH> WELL YOU HA WHEN YOU FILL UP THE SYRINGE YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THIS LEVER IS ALL THE WAY DOWN CAUSE IF IT'S UP IT JUST HAS AIR SO YOU CAN'T REALLY PULL IT ANY FARTHER UP SO THE WATER WON'T GO IN SO YOU MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S ALL THE WAY DOWN SO THERE'S NO AIR FOR THE SO THE WATER CAN GO IN <FP> AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PULL IT IT TAKES A WHILE TO GET USED TO IT BECAUSE I MEAN IT IT SU FIRST IT'S SO HARD TO LIKE PULL IT <BREATH> BUT THEN WHEN YOU SORT WHEN YOU SORTA GET USED TO IT IT'S NOT SO BAD
SO SO YOU'RE MORE
MMM NOT REALLY
WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S THE SAME THING AS THE OTHER ONE EXCEPT THEY JUST FLIPPED UP <LAUGH>
THAT'S A F THAT'S A UM
NO B THE OTHER PEOPLE WERE SAYING LIKE WELL THEIR BOTTLE WAS LIKE ONE BOTTLE BIGGER THAN OURS AND THEY WERE LIKE SAYING LIKE TWO THOUSAND AND STUFF SO THEIRS IS ONE BOTTLE BIGGER SO <FP> I JUST PICKED A THOUSAND SO
YEAH THIS IS LIKE EXACTLY WHAT WE USE
IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A THOUSAND OF THOSE GRAM PIECES AND THEN THIS IS PROBABLY IF YOU STICK EM ALL TOGETHER LIKE REALLY TIGHT IT'D PROBABLY EQUAL THAT <LAUGH>
UM <BREATH> WELL I'M <BREATH>
UM WE'RE WE WERE UM STUDYING MASS AND UM LIKE AND WE'RE LIKE USING GRAMS AND THAT STUFF UM <BREATH>
I PROBABLY USE THAT INSTEAD OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF THOSE <BREATH> CAUSE THAT'S LIKE WAY BIGGER THAN THAT SO THAT ONE'S PROBABLY A BETTER LIKE THING TO PUT IN THE CUPS AND YOU KNOW
WELL UM I'VE WEIGHED GRAVEL <FP> MY MOUSE DROID AND UM I'VE WEIGHED A MARKER AND WELL <LAUGH> THE MARKER SORT OF STOOD UP LIKE THIS IN THE CUP <LAUGH> AND UM SO I GUESSED TEN BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S PRETTY LIGHT IT WAS LIKE THE SKINNY KIND <BREATH> AND SO I PUT A TEN IN AND IT WAS EXACTLY TEN
YEAH W F FIRST I HOLD IT IN MY HANDS AND I WEIGH IT AND THEN I PUT IT IN IT AND THEN I GUESS
WELL YOU COULD LIKE UM YOU COULD TAKE THE ORANGE OUT YOU COULD WEIGH A DIFFERENT THING THEN YOU COULD SEE HOW MUCH THAT WEIGHS AND THEN YOU CAN PUT THAT THING IN AND PUT THE BACK ORANGE IN AND THEN YOU CAN AND THEN YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT THING WEIGHS SO YOU KNOW <BREATH> THAT'S HOW THAT'S HOW I'D DO IT BECAUSE I USUALLY RUN OUT OF THEM YEAH <BREATH> UH-HUH
NO NOT REALLY
WELL
WELL I JUST UM ESTIMATED WELL UM I JUST TOOK MY CUP AND I STUCK IT IN AND I PUT IT IN THE BAG AND THEN I JUST TOOK IT OVER TO MY SEAT I PUT THE BAG IN AND THEN WELL FIRST I PUT IN A HUNDRED OF THOSE AND I PUT IN WELL BECAUSE MY FRIEND MATT HAS THIS TURTLE THAT WEIGHS SEVENTY FOUR <BREATH> SO I PUT IN THE SEVENTY FOUR AND THEN I PUT IN A TWENTY THAT'S NINETY FOUR <BREATH> AND THEN I PUT IN A S UM A FIVE THAT'S NINETY NINE THEN I PUT IN A ONE THAT WAS ONE HUNDRED AND IT WEIGHED NO <LAUGH> IT'S A SHARPENER <LAUGH>
OH YEAH AND UM IT'S JUST BECAUSE IF IT'S LIKE WAY DOWN HERE YOU WOULDN'T GUESS LIKE ONE <LAUGH> GRAM BECAUSE HOW COULD THAT BE POSSIBLE
NO NOT YET
WELL WE USUALLY DO ESTIMATES TO LIKE UM MAKE OUR BRAINS MORE USED TO IT BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DO ESTIMATES AND IF YOU GET USED TO ESTIMATES IT WILL HELP YOU LIKE UM BY WORKING ON LIKE CO UM MASS AND MEASUREMENT AND THAT
WELL YOU'RE JUST SORT OF LOOKING AT HOW FAR DOWN OR UP OR WHATEVER UM IT IS THE THE BALANCE IS AND IF IT'S LIKE WAY DOWN HERE YOU PROBABLY GUESSED LIKE I USUALLY GUESS LIKE TWENTY BECAUSE BUT ONE TIME IT W WHEN I'D WHEN I'D PUT A TWENTY IN IT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE SO I PUT A FORTY IN DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE AND FINALLY FIFTY WENT LIKE THIS AND UM IT'S JUST LIKE UM <BREATH> SO WHAT WAS THE QUESTION AGAIN
NO WELL THAT'S NOT ONE GRAM THE WELL THE LITTLE ONES ARE FIVE GRAMS THE LITTLEST ONES LIKE THAT LOOK LIKE THAT ARE FIVE GRAMS AND THEN THE BIGGER ONES ARE A LITTLE BIG BIGGER THAN THAT
MMM HMM YEAH WELL YOU HAVE TO LIKE WAIT TIL IT EVENS OUT AND THEN YOU CHECK REALLY GOOD AND IF IT'S EVEN THEN YOU <BREATH> THEN IT'S GOOD <LAUGH>
WELL <BREATH> TEN TEN A HUNDRED BAGS EQUALS ONE UM EQUALS A THOUSAND AND THAT'S WHAT A KILOGRAM IS SO A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS ONE KILOGRAM
AND WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE THE BASE THE FULCRUM AND THE BALANCE
YEAH
WELL WELL A GRAM IT'S
UM <BREATH> IT'S JUST LIKE A LITTLE WELL WE DON'T REALLY USE A REAL LIKE GRAM THING WE JUST USE A PAPER CLIP SO IT'S SORT OF <LAUGH> UM HARD TO LIKE EXPLAIN HOW THEY LIKE MAKE EM AND STUFF SO
WELL THEY THEY LOOK THE SAME EXCEPT LIKE THE TEN IS BIGGER THAN THE FIVE AND THE FIVE IS SMALLER THAN THE TEN AND THE TWENTY'S THE BIGGEST WELL JUST WHEN WE'RE WORKING WITH SCIENCE LIKE THAT'S LIKE RIGHT BEFORE LUNCH <LAUGH>
A BIG ONE EQUAL YEAH A BIG ONE EQUALS A GRAM
MMM HMM AND THEN I PUT IN THE BAG AND I WAITED UNTIL IT GOT LIKE UM LEVEL AND IT <FP>
YEAH
WELL UM WE JUST DO ESTIMATES LIKE UM UH EDUCT- EDUCATED GUESS AND
YEAH WE WE TALK ABOUT IT A FEW A TWO TI A FEW TIMES BUT UM WE'VE ONLY DONE SCIENCE TWICE SINCE WE'VE FINISHED UM UM AFRICAN AMERICANS AND THOSE PEOPLE LIKE THE UP ARAPAHO CHEYENNE JUTES AND SO OTHERWISE WE'VE ONLY DONE TWO LESSONS IN IT WE DO IT EVERY WEDNESDAY
THIS WELL THAT'S THE FULCRUM AND IT'S THE PART WHERE WHERE YOU PUT THE BALANCE ON LIKE AND IT'S WHERE YOU GET IT LIKE EVEN
UM A FULK THE FULCRUM IS THE TIP THAT YOU THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PUT THE BALANCE ON IT AND IT'S LIKE THIS AND THEN THIS IS LIKE THE OTHER S SIDES AND THEN IT'S LIKE THIS WHAT THE FULCRUM LOOKS LIKE AND THEN THE BALANCE IS ON TOP LIKE THIS
YEAH YEAH
WE'RE WORKING WITH THAT THAT AND THAT
MMM NO
WELL UM I WEIGHED LIKE A MOUSE DROID IT A LITTLE A A MOUSE DROID IT'S A STAR WARS CHARACTER IN A IN STAR WARS AND IT'S LIKE REALLY LIGHT AND SO I GUESSED ONE ONE GRAM AND IT WAS EXACTLY ONE GRAM <LAUGH> YEAH IT <FP> LIKE WHEN WHEN I PUT IT IN THE FULCRUM WAS LIKE JUST LIKE THIS A LITTLE LIKE THE THE BALANCE WAS JUST A LITTLE TILTED THIS WAY AND I PUT ONE IN IT WAS LIKE AND IT JUST WENT RIGHT INTO
WELL GRAMS UM THEY USE EM IN THE METRIC SYSTEM NOT THE NOT UM OUR SYSTEM <LAUGH> S AND UM WE'RE JUST USING THE METRIC SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S IT'S BETTER TO LEARN LIKE ALL THE SYSTEMS AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE I JUST LEARNED THAT WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT UH THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE METRIC SYSTEM AND I HOPE WE SWITCH TO METRIC SYSTEM SOMED- YEAH BECAUSE THE METRIC SYSTEM IS LIKE SO MUCH EASIER
WELL IT'S GOING PRETTY GOOD <LAUGH> AND WELL IT'S CAUSE UM F WELL FIRST WE'RE TAKING OBJECTS FROM OUR DESKS AND WE'RE PUTTING EM IN WELL THE THEY'RE PLASTIC CUPS NOT LIKE UM LIKE SCIENTISTS USE JUST PLASTIC SO WE'RE PUTTING EM IN THE PLASTIC CUPS AND WE'RE MEASURING EM WITH UM WELL PA A PAPER CLIP IS ONE GRAM UM A UH A BLOCK <BREATH> WELL WE SORT OF WELL MY TEACH WELL I DIDN'T FIGURE IT OUT MY TEACHER DID <BREATH> AND SO UM I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DID IT THOUGH <LAUGH> AND UM UH WELL ALSO UM WE'VE BEEN LIKE WE'RE WE WERE DOING WE WERE ALSO DOING LIKE GRAVEL UM HOW MU WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH GRAVEL EQUALS A HUNDRED AND THEY'RE LIKE JUST LITTLE AND UM SO I GOT A BAG FULL AND I MEASURED IT AND IT *WAS* EDA EXACTLY A HUNDRED <LAUGH> YEAH MMM HMM
WELL BECAUSE LIKE UM A <BREATH> WELL LIKE A FOOT LIKE <LAUGH> IT'S TWELVE IT'S NOT TEN SO THAT'S PROB THAT'S UM LIKE WEIRD BECAUSE IT'D BE MORE EASIER IF IT WAS TEN AND LIKE A YARD IT'S THREE FEET SO
YEAH IT'S JUST THAT THESE ARE A HUNDRED OF THOSE UM GRAM PIECES AND THIS IS JUST UM IT LOOKS LIKE A GLASS BOT- LIKE A GOLD BOTTLE <BREATH> AND SO IT'S IT WEIGHS THE SAME JUST BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THAT'S BIGGER BECAUSE THIS THIS IT JUST WEIGHS THE SAME BECAUSE UM IF YOU IF YOU GET THI IF YOU HOLD THAT IN ONE HAND AND THAT IN THE OTHER YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T FEEL ANY DIFFERENCE IT'D PROBABLY JUST FEEL LIKE BOTH NO
YEAH
NO WE HAVEN'T
WELL IT JUST UM LET'S THE BALANCE UM S IT MAKES IT STEADY AND NOT LIKE WIBBLE WOBBY
THE PAPER CLIP IF IT WAS LIGHTER IT WOULD EVE WEIGH LESS BUT IF IT WAS HEAVIER IT WOULD WEIGH LEA LESS IT WOULD WEIGH MORE SO YOU'D HAVE LESS TO USE IF YOU HAD IT HEAVIER BUT YOU'D HAVE MORE TO USE IF IT WAS LIGHTER
WE MEASURED THEM AND FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY WERE AND IT WAS PRETTY COOL
IT'S ALL ABOUT UM HELPING YOU GET THE EQUAL ANSWER IF YOU HAVE FOUR PAPER CLIPS ON SOMETHING THAT MEANS IT'S FOUR *PAPEL* CLIPS HEAVY BUT IT CAN BE HE A BIGGER PAPER CLIP AND THE PAPER CLIP WILL BE A LOT HEAVIER IF IT'S BIGGER
USE A SCALE
<BREATH> TO SEE WHAT MATERIAL THEY'RE MADE OF AND THEN WE'D BE ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY WOULD BE
THEY ALL ARE MADE OF DIFFERENT ME MATERIALS SO THEY MAKE DIFFERENT SO THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT THINGS
<BREATH> SEE THERE'S EIGHT GRAMS IN THIS CUP SO THE CUP IS THIS METAL DISC IS EQUAL TO EIGHT GRAMS THAT'S HOW YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT
IT WILL HELP YOU KNOW THE EXACT SI THE EXACT WAY ABOUT IT AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
GOOD
GRAMS ARE WELL GRAMS ARE THE EQU- ARE THE WEIGHT AGREED ALL ALL AROUND THE WORLD AND GRAMS JUST ARE EQUAL SO EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE
YES
I COULD USE THEM TO PUT THE THINGS ON THE SCALE AND SEE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH
TO SEE HOW MUCH THEY BOTH WEIGH
IS FIGURING OUT HOW HEAVY IT IS TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE CORRECT
WEIGHING THE PLASTIC DISC WAS ALL ABOUT ABOUT SEEING HOW MANY GRAMS IT WAS AND WHA- AND HOW MU HOW HEAVY IT WOULD EQUAL
THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE BASK INT- THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE SCALE
IT'S ALL ABOUT ONE GRAM ONE GRAM EQUALS JUST ABOUT ONE T P TINY PARTICLE OF EACH TW- THING WE HAVE HERE
A SCALE
PAPER CLIP IS NOT EQUAL TO ONE GRAM ONE GRAM IS A LOT LIGHTER THAN A LARGE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE A PAPER CLIP ET WEIGH A LARGE PAPER CLIP WEIGHS MORE THAN ONE GRAM
TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THE METAL DISC IS
I PUT THE THINGS IN THE BUCKETS TO SEE HOW HEAVY THEY WERE
THEIR MASS IS HEAVIER SO THEY WEIGH MORE
WE COULD PUT IT ON A SCALE
METAL IS HEAVIER THAN PLASTIC AND WOOD SO THAT MAKES IT HEAVIER
THANK YOU
AS LONG AS IT IS HEAVY ER SO YOU CAN MAKE IT EQUAL IF IT'S EQUAL THAT MEANS HOW MANY OF THEM ARE THER- ARE IN THE CUP THAT HAS THE GRAMS IN 'EM THE MORE THE EQE- THE WEIGHT YOU COUNT THE IF YOU COUNT THEM YOU CAN FIND THEM YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY ARE
WE'VE BEEN PRACTICING MEASUREMENT
THE WEIGHT IS HEAVIER AND SO IT IS JUST A LOT EASIER TO USE
THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS HEAVIER
Y WE'RE TRYING TO SEE HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WILL FIT INTO EACH CUP INTO THE CUPS TO MAKE IT EQUAL TO THE PLASTIC CHIP
IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT THE MASS OF AN OBJECT BECAUSE <BREATH> YOU WON'T KNOW HOW HEAVY IT IS AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HEAVY IT IS <BREATH> YOU COULDN'T GET IT IT'S LIKE SAY FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'RE GETTING A BED IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE EIGHT GRAMS HEAVY YOU WOULDN'T KNOW HOW HEAVY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE UNLESS YOU WEIGHED IT AND FOUND OUT
BYE
IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS UNLESS Y IF YOU WANT TO GET IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW E MUCH SOMETHING WEIGHS N TO GET IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY SOMETHING
STEEL NAIL HAS STEEL IN IT AND THE ALUMINUM NAIL IS *ALUNIMUM* *ALUNIMUM* DOESN'T ATTRACT TO MAGNETS
THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING IRON <BREATH> AND THE STUFF THAT STICKS TO MAGNETS
GOOD
<BREATH> NORTH AND S N AND S ARE UM <BREATH> ON ONE SIDE THEY WILL ATTRACT BUT IF LIKE N AND N OR S AND S <BREATH> ARE ON ONE SIDE THEY'LL REPEL
UM THE ONES WITH IRON AND STEEL IN THEM CONNECT TO THE MAGNET
THE UM SOME OF THE THINGS THAT UH DON'T HAVE IRON IN THEM WON'T STICK TO THE MAGNET <BREATH> LIKE THE BRASS RING <BREATH> OR UM THE CRAFTER'S STICK
THE ONE ON THE TOP IS ATTRACTED TO THE OTHER ONE A BUT THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM <BREATH> IS REPEALING THE OTHER
IF THE *POOLS* ARE FACING TOGETHER THEY MIGHT STICK <BREATH> BUT IF THEY'RE FACING APART THEY'LL SEPARATE
*MAGANETS* ATTRACT THAT MEANS THEY STICK TOGETHER IF THEY REPEL <BREATH> THEN THEY'RE APART FROM EACH OTHER
THAT SOME SIDES UM <BREATH> STICK AND LIKE IF YOU PUT IT ON A CERTAIN SIDE IT DOESN'T STICK <BREATH> IT UM LET'S GO APART
THAT IT WILL UM A THAT IT WILL COLLECT ALL THE IRON THINGS OR THE ONES THAT HAVE STEEL IN 'EM
LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
IT'S A MAGNET
ROCK HAS IRON OR STEEL IN IT
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH ENDS OF THE MOTOR ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERIES AND THAT I MEAN THE WIRES AND THEN THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERIES PROPERLY FOR THE MOTOR TO RUN
THIS SHOWS YOU THAT THIS CIRCUIT IS OPEN AND THAT THE MOTOR CAN'T RUN BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT CLOSED THE SWITCH
YOU USE THE D CELL TO MAKE THE MOTOR RUN OR THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT WITHOUT IT YOU COULDN'T DO ANYTHING <BREATH>
I SEE A LITTLE UM DRAWING THAT SHOWS YOU IN THESE LITTLE UM WHAT DO YOU CALL UM
THE D CELL IS A SOURCE OF EL ELECTRICITY TO TURN ON SOMETHING
<BREATH> THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES AND BOTH WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE UM THE ENERGY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND COMES BACK AT THE POSITIVE SIDE
A SCHEMATIC SHOWS YOU A SIMPLER WAY TO DRAW OR TELL SOMEONE HOW TO SH DO SOMETHING OR GO SOMEWHERE <BREATH>
THEY TELL YOU HOW TO CONNECT THE BATTERY AND WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND SHOW YOU IN A SIMPLER WHERE WAY
YOU CONNECT THE WIRES TO IT AND THEN IT FLOWS TO THE BATTERY AND THAT STARTS MOVING THE MOTOR ON THE TOP <BREATH>
THE MOTOR UM I MEAN THE D CELL HELPS YOU HELPS IT RUN BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE YOU COULD REALLY DO I MEAN IT WOULDN'T WORK
GOOD <BREATH>
IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND SO THE ENERGY CAN'T GO OUT BUT IF ONE OF THE WIRES WERE OPEN THEN YOU COULDN'T DO IT
I SEE UM A LIGHT BULB AND THAT ONE OF THE WIRES IS CONNECTED TO THE SIDE AND THE OTHER ONE IS CONNECTED TO THE BOTTOM AND THAT IT LIGHTS UP WHEN THAT HAPPENS
THE NAMES OF A THOSE LITTLE CIRCLES AT THE BOTTOM ARE CALLED TERMINAL *CONNECTITIONS* AN AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT THEN UM YOU AND IF YOU DON'T CONNECT ANYTHING TO THE MOTOR THE MOTOR'S NOT GONNA RUN <BREATH>
UM THERE'S A IT'S LIKE A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND UM I DON'T SEE A SWITCH THERE'S NO SWITCH IT'S JUST THE BATTERY AND THE WIRES AND UM THE BA- THE LIGHT BULB UM RECEIVES THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY AND THEN SENDS IT SOME OF IT BACK
THEY'RE WIRES THAT YOU USE TO CONNECT THE D CELL TO THE UM THE MOTOR OR LIGHT BULB <BREATH>
UM I FORGET ITS NAME BUT I THINK IT STARTS WITH AN S AND IT USES SYMBOLS TO TELL YOU INSTEAD OF JUST DRAWING ALL THE DETAILS
INSTEAD OF A LIGHT BULB THERE IS A MOTOR AND IT'S CONNECTED TO THE D CELL BATTERY
<BREATH> THEY MEAN THAT THE WIRES ON THE MOTOR STOP THERE AND ARE CONNECTED TO NEW WIRES
THE ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE UH SORT OF LIKE A SWITCH BUT ISN'T IT'S FOR YOUR CIRCUIT TO BE CLOSED IF YOU OPEN IT THEN YOU DON'T THEN YOUR CIRCUIT WILL BE OPEN AND THE LIGHT BULB OR MOTOR WON'T WORK BUT IF YOU BY IT IT'LL WORK
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND ELECTRICITY
A AND D ARE CONNECTED THE BRA IT THE WIRES ARE SORT OF WITH THE TOUCHING THE BRADS SO IT'S A FULL CIRCUIT IF THEY ARE NOT TOUCHING THEN THE CIRCUIT WILL NOT WORK SO UM WHEN THE WIRES ARE WORKING THE THE LIGHT BULB'S WORKING BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING A AND B AND THERE'S A WIRE IN BETWEEN THEM SO THE LIGHT BULB'S GONNA LIGHT BUT IF YOU DO C AND B IT WON'T WORK
WE FOUND OUT WHERE THE WIRES WERE BY TESTING THEM WITH OUR UM BOARDS TO LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB IF WE TOUCHED TWO WIRES AND THE LIGHT BULB DIDN'T LIGHT UP THAT MEANS THERE ISN'T WIRES CONNECTED TO THEM <BREATH>
GOOD <BREATH>
TODAY WE DID THIS FUN MYSTERY THING WITH WI- FINDING WIRES
THERE ARE NO WIRES CONNECTED TO B
UNDER THOSE BRADS THERE'S A WIRE AND WHEN THE TWO WIRES TOUCH THE BRADS S THE WIRE IMMEDIATELY B UM MAKES THE OPEN CIRCUIT A CLOSED CIRCUIT
WELL WE DID WITH THEM IS OUR TEACHER HID WIRES UN UM UNDER CERTAIN BRADS LIKE CONNECTED THEM FOR EXAMPLE A AND B WOULD HAVE BEEN CONNECTED OR D AND A WOULD HAVE BEEN CONNECTED AND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO FIND WHICH WIRE IS WHERE UNDER WHICH BRADS AND THE WAY WE FOUND OUT IS WE CONNECTED THE WIRES TO THE BRADS AND WE PLAYED AROUND WITH THIS FOR A WHILE AND SO WE FIGURED OUT THAT WHERE THE UM BRAD WHERE THE WIRES WERE AND WROTE THEM IN ON OUR SHEETS AND IT'S CALLED THE MYSTERY B BOARD BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE WHERE THE WIRES ARE YOU HAVE TO TEST AND SEE IF YOUR TEST IS YOUR TESTING WAS CORRECT
THE WASHERS UM ARE STACKED UP AND IF YOU PUT THEM GENTLY ON YOU CAN COUNT OUT MORE BUT IF YOU LIKE SLAP 'EM ON YOU'LL GET LESS AND THE MAGNETS WILL BREAK SOONER
THE NINETEEN WASHERS SEPARATED THE TWO MAGNETS IF YOU PUT THE MAG IF YOU PUT THE WASHERS INSIDE AND COUNT UP TO NINETEEN IT THE TWO MAGNETS WILL PROBABLY SEPARATE BY THEN
LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETISM
GROUP C JUST DUMPED THE WHO WHOLE J DUMPED FIVE WASHERS IN TO THE CUP INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM NEATLY LIKE THE REST OF THE GROUPS THAT'S WHY THE REST OF THE GROUPS HAVE MORE UM THAN FIVE WASHERS
YOU SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT MATERIAL AND UM JUST SET IT UP RIGHT
FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AND BE CREATIVE
THE MAGNET WILL REPEL THEMSELVES BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH SPACE BETWEEN THEM THAT THEY CAN'T ATTRACT ANYMORE
THE MAGNETS UM REPEL THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF THE SPACE IS TAKING AWAY MOST OF THE FORCE
IF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE MAGNETS ARE A LOT THEN THE LESS WASHERS IT'LL NEED LIKE IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF SPACES IN BETWEEN THEM YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO END UP WITH ONE WASHER
DON'T PUT ANY SPACES IN YOU GET A HIGHER NUMBER BUT IF YOU PUT FIVE SPACES IN YOU GET LIKE THREE OR TWO OR ONE OR SOMETHING
IF YOU HAVE MORE SPACERS THE MAGNETS FORCE WILL BE LESS SO THEREFORE YOUR WASHERS THAT YOU PUT IN WILL TURN OUT LESS BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE SPACES IN BETWEEN THE MAGNETS
MORE WASHERS YOU PUT IN THERE UM LIKE IF YOU PUT TWENTY THEY'LL PROBABLY SEPARATE QUICKER
THE MAGNETS HAD TO REPEL THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF THE WEIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS TOO HEAVY FOR THE F MAGNET F FORCE TO STICK TOGETHER
UM THE CUP ON THE RIGHT FILLED WITH WASHERS IS <BREATH> TOO HEAVY FOR THE TWO MAGNETS TO STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
GOOD
THE NINETEEN WASHERS UM BROKE THE FORCE OF THE TWO MAGNETS
YOU KIND OF SEE HOW MANY WASHERS IT TOOK T FOR UH THE MAGNET T TISE THE MAGNETS TO SEPARATE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS
IF YOU DECREASE THE WASHERS THE FORCE OF THE MAGNETS WILL GET LESS AND LESS AND THEN SOON THEY'LL UM REPEL THEMSELVES
THE CUP ON THE RIGHT UM THE NINETEEN WASHERS INSIDE OF IT UM IS BREAKING THE FORCE OF THE CUP ON THE LEFT WHICH ARE THE TWO MAGNETS CONNECTED
SPACES IN BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS MAKE LITTLE FORCE FOR THE MAGNETS SO WHEN YOU PUT ONE WASH
THE TWO MAGNETS UM SORT OF SEPARATE BUT NOT THAT MUCH BECAUSE THERE'S NO WASHERS ON THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE THE SPACES ARE STACKING UP THEN UM BUT SINCE THE TWO MAGNETS ARE SEPARATING AND THE SPACES ARE COMING UP THE CUP ON THE RIGHT IS MORE HEAVIER THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
<NO_SIGNAL>
ON THE FRONT OF THAT IT GOES THROUGH THE PLUS SIGN DOWN TO THE MINUS
WHEN I CLICK THE THING AGAIN IT WILL TURN THE BATTERY AROUND AND IT WON'T
BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THE RIGHT PATHWAY WELL BUT NOT THE PLUS THE PLUS SIGNS YOU HAVE TO BE FACING UP THE PLUS SIGN HAVE TO BE FACING THE OTHER BUT ONE ON THE LEFT TOUCH BE FACING THE OTHER DIRECTION
THE ONE WITH ONLY ONE D-CELL THE LIGHTS ARE DIMMER ALONG WITH 2 D-CELLS THE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT
WIRES BATTERIES AND LIGHT BULB
COULD YOU
THE WIRE THE WIRES THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY THEY ARE ALL GOOD GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT MAKING THE LIGHT BULB
YEAH HOPE SUCH HUGE ENERGY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO WOULDN'T SHOW
CLOSER THE LITTLE POWER SOURCES THAT ARE IN THE THAT ARE IN THE WIRES AND
THE LIGHTS ARE GET THEM
YOU KNOW THAT REALLY LIGHT AND WEIGHT
WHEN WE USE (*) THE WIRES THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULB ALL MAKE A PATHWAY AND THIS IT GOES THROUGH AND IT MAKES A COMPLETE
WE'VE BEEN USING MAGNETS CONNECTING ON THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WOULD STICK
ON THE RIGHT ONE WHEN TIME PASSES THE LIGHT BULB RUNS OUT SO I HAVE TO REPLACE IT MANY MANY TIMES BECAUSE +HM+ MORE ENERGY IS BEING TAKEN FROM IT
IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
TURN THE BATTERY AROUND
THE ONE D-CELL MAYBE DIMMER BUT 2 D-CELLS ONCE BATTERIES ARE RARE EQUAL
THE BULB CIRCUIT A LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER
WHEN I CLICK ON THE D-CELL IT MOVES IT IT MOVES THE DIRECTION AND IT ACTUALLY FLOWS IN THE CIRCUIT THIS TIME
ON THE POWER WHEN IT MOVES THROUGH ON IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LITTLE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE WIRES AND IF THEY MOVE AROUND AND THAT KIND OF VIBRATE
IF YOU DON'T DO CORRECTLY COULD SHOCK YOU OR +UM+ IT CAN HURT
TO MAKE LIGHT OR TO USE LIKE A (*)
IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THROUGH THE WIRES COMPLETELY AND IF YOU GET STUCK OR
ONE

WOOD GRASS DIRT
THAT THE MAGNET WILL NOT STICK TO THE WOOD BLOCK BUT THE NAIL WOULD STICK TO THE MAGNET
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
YEAH
(*)
THAT +UM+ THE MAG- THE CIRCLE MAGNET IS STICKING TO THE NAIL
STEEL BECAUSE STEEL CAN +UH+ STICK TO MAGNETS
ONE IS STEEL OR ONE IS STEEL AND ONE IS PAPER
THAT IT STICKED
THAT THERE ARE MAGNETS AND THEY HAVE A NORTH POLE AND SOUTH POLE
I DON’T KNOW
THAT THEY STICK TO THINGS AND THE NORTH POLE AND THE SOUTH POLE WILL NOT GO TOGETHER THE FORCE WILL BREAK THEM APART
STEEL
I DID
THAT IT IS METAL
BECAUSE IT HAS STEEL OR IRON IN IT
THAT IT IS METAL
IT WILL STICK
THAT MOST OF THE THINGS THAT STICK TO MAGNETS ARE METAL STEEL AND IRON AND WOOD CAN'T AND LEAVES AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NOT METAL TYPE
I DON’T KNOW
<SILENCE>
ENERGY LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE
THAT IT WOULDN'T STICK BECAUSE PAPER CANNOT STICK TO MAGNETS
THAT THE MAGNET'S STICKING TO THE STEEL BUT THE PAPER OR OTHER ONE THAT STICKS TO THE MAGNET
THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT CAN STICK AND NOT STICK ON TO THEM AND THE NORTH POLE AND SOUTH POLE
BECAUSE THE WOOD IS NOT A METAL BUT THE NAIL IS
STEEL OR METAL OR IRON
THAT THEY STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THE FORCE BRINGS THEM TOGETHER
BECAUSE IT IS METAL AND IT’S STICKING TO A MAGNET- INSIDE OF THE MAGNET STICKING TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNET WEIGHS MORE THAN THE NAIL
I DON’T KNOW
THAT THE +UM+ A STEEL NAIL IS CONNECTING TO THE MAGNET SO THE MAGNETISM GOES TO THE TIP OF THE STEEL AND THAT’S PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP
THAT THE MAGNET- MAGNET +UM+ MAGNET +UH+ I DON’T KNOW
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
THAT THE MAGNETISM IS GOING TO THE NAIL WHICH THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET
THAT THE FORCE IN THE SMALL STACK IS NOW AS BIG BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS ROUND I GUESS THAT’S HOW YOU CALL IT AND THE BIGGER STACK IS- IS MORE FIXED SO THE MAGNET HAS A HARDER TIME GOING THROUGH INTO I DON’T KNOW ABOUT THAT
THAT THE MAGNETISM FROM THE MAGNET IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL TO MAKE THE +UH+ THE STEEL NAIL TO MAKE THE PAPER CLIP STICK TO THE STEEL NAIL
THAT WOULDN'T +UH+ THE NAIL IS CODUCTING ELECTRICITY +UH+ HAS ELECTRICITY IN IT AND WHEN IT TOUCHES THE NAIL THE NAIL HAS ELECTRICITY IN IT TOO
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
THAT THE MAGNET IS GETTING TAKING OFF OF THE NAIL AND +AH+ SO THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET AND THE- A MAG- NAIL IS STARTING TO TOUCH THE PAPER CLIP BUT THE PAPER CLIP IS NOT STICKING ON IT UNLESS THE MAGNET GETS PUT ON
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
HI CARL
GOOD
THAT THE NAIL WON'T BE A MAGNET ANYMORE IT WILL JUST BE A PLAIN OUT NAIL
THAT THERE ARE MAGNETIC <LAUGH> COULD YOU REPEAT THAT
I DON’T CARE
THAT THE MAGNET CANNOT ATTRACT TO THE OTHER MAGNET THROUGH THAT THICK OF PAPER
THAT MAGNETS STICK TOGETHER
THAT +UH+ THE MAGNET +UM+ THAT THE NAIL IS GETTING TAKEN OFF THE NAIL THEN THE MAGNET IS GETTING TAKEN OFF THE NAIL SO THE NAIL IS BECOMING A MAGNET AND NOT BECOMING A MAGNET
THAT ALL MAGNETS HAVE SOME SORT OF METAL IN
THAT THE MAGNETISM GOES THROUGH THE TABLE TO- FOR THE MAGNET TO STICK TO THE- STICK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE
THEY HAVE OTHER METAL IN THEM WHICH MAGNETS CAN ATTRACT TO
COULD YOU REPEAT THAT
I DON’T KNOW
THAT THE MAGNET IS- HAS BEEN TAKING OFF SO THE NAIL DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORE MAGNETISM IN IT SO THE NAIL IS NOT- ISN'T A MAGNET ANYMORE
THAT THE MAGNETISM FROM THE MAGNET IS GOING TO THE NAIL WHICH THE +UH+ NAIL IS GOING- THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL AND THE NAIL IS GETTING PICKED UP FROM THE MAGNETISM AND THE MAGNETISM IS GOING TO THE PAPER CLIP
THAT UNTIL THE MAGNET GETS TAKEN OFF +UH+ THE NAIL IS A MAGNET BUT WHEN THE NAIL DOES GET TAKEN OFF THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET
THAT +UM+ ONE STACK IS BIGGER THAN ANOTHER SO THE MAGNET <LAUGH> (*) ONE OR ANOTHER
NORTH AND SOUTH HAVE NORTH IN SOUTH AND SOUTH IN NORTH HAVE TO BE STICK IT TOGETHER FOR TO MAKE A MAGNET CONNECT IF SOUTH AND SOUTH AND NORTH AND NORTH ARE CONNECTED THEY WILL NOT THEY WON'T CONNECT IT'LL JUST BE A MAGNETIC FORCE
IT WON'T WORK
WOOD DOESN'T STICK TO A MAGNET SO ON THE MAGNET IS TRYING TO STICK TO IT BUT IT WON'T
BECAUSE IT HAS IRON AND
THEY ARE MAGNETS AND THEY HAVE NORTH AND SOUTH HENCE EXCEPT FOR THE ONE THE THAT SHAPE LIKE A (*)
METAL AND IRON
<NO_SIGNAL>
WOOD IRON AND COPPER
NO
THREE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE AND THERE ALL ON ON THEIR END
ORE AND IRON
FLOWS OF
<NO_SIGNAL>
BECAUSE THAT NAIL IS MAGNETIC
I THINK IT HAS SOME KIND ORE IN IT
GOOD YOU
THE ONES THAT STICK TO THE MAGNET IT STICK TO IT THAT ONE SIDE DON'T IF YOU TRY TO MAKE IT STICK TO IT WILL
A STEEL OF STEEL NAIL IS CONNECTED TO THE DOOR NUT BRING MAGNET
THEY'RE BOTH MAGNETIC FORCES
BECAUSE A REFRIGERATOR IS METAL OR IRON IT JUST HAS PAINT ON IT AND THEY'RE STICKING THERE (*)  ON THE FRIDGE
IT HAS TO BE EITHER METAL OR IRON
YEAH
FOR ONE THAT DOESN'T STICK ISN'T A MAGNET THAT IS A MAGNETIC FORCE THAT WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET THE OTHER ONE IS
IT WILL WORK
IT'S ALL ONE BIG SIDE
IRON AND STEEL
IT'S MADE OF IRON AND IT'S COVERED IN STEEL
IRON
ALUMINUM
SO WHITE NAIL IS A MAGNETIC A MAGNETIC FORCE SO ITS NOT STICKING TO IT
WHEN NORTH AND SOUTH GO ON TO EACH OTHER THEY CONNECT BUT IF NORTH AND NORTH AND SOUTH AND SOUTH TRY TO CONNECT IT WILL WORK
<NO_SIGNAL>
IT WORKED
<NO_SIGNAL>
IT'S IMPORTANT CAUSE IT HELPS US LIGHT THINGS AND IT HELPS US USE THINGS A LOT BETTER
I DON'T KNOW
IT GETS POLLUTED
SOMEBODY'S HITTING THE BONGOS WITH THEIR HANDS AND IT'S MAKING SOUND ENERGY AND MOVEMENT ENERGY
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT AND
SHE'S WALKING EATING CARRYING AND THAT'S IT
IT HAS A BIG IMPACT AND THAT EFFECTS THE AIR
OKAY
MAYBE
THE FIRE THE FIRE UM POLLUTES AIR AND THE
I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
IT BURNS AND THE WAX IT MELTS
IT'S GONE AND YOU CAN NEVER USE IT AGAIN
UH POLLUTE
GASOLINE
IT GIVE OUT MORE AIR BECAUSE OF THE THE
THEY'RE ALL LIGHT SOURCES
THE FLAME IS MOVING
I DON'T KNOW
NOTHING
HIEE
IT'LL MAKE A FIRE
IT GETS POLLUTED WITH SMOKE
IT'S A CANDLE THAT HAS A LIGHT
GOOD YOU
THE WAX IS MELTING OFF OF IT
LIGHT
IT WILL MAKE A FIRE
UH IT SOUNDED KINDA LIKE POPPING A LITTLE BIT CAUSE IS A BIG FLAME
APPLES A SOLAR PANEL A DESK A A FAN TREE BRANCHES RAISINS AND FUEL
UM THE FLAME GLARES OFF AND IT MOVES AROUND THAT'S WHY IT LOOKS LIKE IT
I DON'T KNOW
IT STOPS
BECAUSE RUNS AT FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY INTO THE WIRES AND OUT OF THE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS INTO THE OTHER ONE THE FILMAMENT BREAKS IT IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT ANYONE
THERE SO MANY WIRES CONNECTING TO THE +UM BATTERY AND IT'S IT'S GOING IN ONE CIRCUIT ON DIFFERENT LIGHT BULB
<NO_SIGNAL>
<NO_SIGNAL>
THIS TIME IT'S CONNECTED TO THE SERIES AND +UM+ WHEN THE WHEN ONE OF THE FILAMENT BREAKS IT STOP
THE BULBS RUNNING NOW
A SERIES CIRCUIT
ONE OF THE LIGHT BULB STOPS NOT BOTH OF THEM
YOU HAVE TO REPLACE IT
BECAUSE THE MAGNET IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
AND ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PARTS OF THE CIRCUIT BREAK
<SILENCE>
THEY DOESN'T FLOW THROUGH ANYMORE
<NO_SIGNAL>
BECAUSE IT'S JUST TO IN ONE CIRCUIT IT'S NOT MULTIPLE CIRCUITS WORKING FLOW THROUGH DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT
THERE IS DIFFERENT WIRES CONNECTED TO IT
<NO_SIGNAL>
COULD YOU
YOU HAVE TO REPLACED
PARALLEL CIRCUIT
NOTHING HAPPEN BECAUSE ITS NOT CONNECTED TO A
<NO_SIGNAL>
<NO_SIGNAL>
<NO_SIGNAL>
NOTHING HAPPEN
ON THERE IS 4 WIRES ONCE CONNECTING IN THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTING INTO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS SO THEY BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS TO HAVE TO BE CONNECTED FOR ONE TO WORK
ONE OF THEM GOES OFF ONE OF THEM STAGE ON
WHEN I CLICK ON IT AND IT MOVES TO THE METAL PART AND IT WATCH THE BULB BUT I THINK THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
<NO_SIGNAL>
<NO_SIGNAL>
<NO_SIGNAL>
BATTERY A LIGHT BULB AND A COUPLE OF WIRES
IT'S GOING +UM+ THROUGH IT'S GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY IN THE POWER SOURCE FROM THE BATTERY AROUND GO IN- GOES INTO THE LIGHT BULB COMES OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB AND GOES AROUND INTO THE
POWER SOURCE
THE BOTTOM
<SIDE_SPEECH> BECAUSE THE TO THE ENDS OF THE WIRES THEY HAVE THE METAL ON THE BOTTOM AND ON THE SIDES AND WHEN YOU PUT ON TOGETHER AND THE OTHER METAL METAL MAKES ELECTRICITY JUST LIKE WHEN LIGHTENING SHARKS METAL IT MAKES A LIGHT SOURCE
POWER
OKAY
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
THE NEGATIVE SIDE
THE METAL MAKES IT OVER WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE IT GIVE SOME POWER AND IT FLOWS THROUGH TO KEEP THE BATTERY THE BATTERY GO THROUGH
BYE AND +UM+ I CAN'T SEE PICTURE BY THE WAY
WELL THE WIRES HELPS THE POWER BECAUSE THEY MELT THE METAL ON THE ENDS AND THEY HELP WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON THE SIDE OF (*) BATTERY IT HELP TO RIFHT THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE THE WIRE HAS POWER RESOURCE
LIGHTS UP
SO BATTERY
GOING TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
IT RECEIVES POWER AND FROM THE +UM+ WIRES AND THE BATTERY
+UM+ IT MEANS AND THERE IS A PATHWAY INSIDE IT TO HELP THE POWER SOURCE KEEP GOING
+UM+ WHEN YOU TURN IT IT GOES THE OTHER WAY AGAIN
THAT ONE ONE PART IS ON THE SIDE ON THE LIGHT BULB ONE PART ON THE BOTTOM AND IT GOES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THROUGH THE BATTERY AND INTO THE WIRE
I NOTICE THAT +UM+ THE TOP OF IT WHEN YOU HAVE THE TOP OF IT IT GOES DOWN IT ALWAYS GOES FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
+UM+ IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE TO ADJUST THE WIRES AND THE PLAIN LIGHT BULB WOULDN’T WORK BECAUSE YOU NEED A POWER SOURCE TO HELP
I SEE THE POWER SOURCE GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT +UM+ IN THE INSIDE OF A LIGHT BULB IT'S GOING ON THE METAL OVER THE FILAMENT AND BACK OUT DOWN AND IT'S KEEP GOING THROUGH IT THROUGH THE BATTERY AND AROUND AND AROUND AND IT GIVES POWER FROM THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB UP
+UM+ IT'S A POWER SOURCE OF ENERGY LIKE ELECTRICAL ENERGY
I'M NOT SURE
IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND <SIDE_SPEECH> IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND <SIDE_SPEECH> NORMAL
IT WOULDN’T LIGHT UP BECAUSE +UM+ YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT BETWEEN IN DIFFERENT PARTS
+UM+ <SIDE_SPEECH> POWER ENERGY AND A LIGHT SOURCE
THEY HELP YOU SEE WHEN IT'S DARK INSTEAD OF A FLASH LIGHT THAT YOU HAVE TO HOLD IN YOUR HAND
NO LIGHT CAME ENOUGH I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S JUST I DIDN'T KNOW THE ELECTRICITY
TAKE
WELL THEY GIVE POWER TO WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO USE
(*)
IT'S GOING FASTER AND FASTER
WHAT
WELL +UM+ WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO LIGHT A LIGHT BULB WITH WIRES AND BATTERY
<NOISE> BECAUSE IT MOVE

BYE
AND THERE IS NOTHING REALLY ELSE TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE INSULATORS JUST
<SIDE_SPEECH>
AND THEY HAVE SORT SOME SORT OF THING THAT THEY ARE MADE OF THAT DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T HELP YOU WORK LIKE THE PAPER CLIP I CLICKED ON YES IT WORK IT’S EITHER A PART OF METAL OR SLIVER SOMETHING AND METAL ONLY SO WERE ALL MAKE IT WORK
<SILENCE>
<SIDE_SPEECH> SO +UM+ WHEN THE ELECTRICITY WHEN THE ELECTRICITY IS TRYING TO FLOW IT WON'T FLOW BECAUSE INSULATORS CAN'T HAVE ELECTRICITY FLOWS
+UM+ THE INSULATORS DO NOT MAKE IT COMPLETE CIRCUIT
+UM+ IT'S MAKING IT WORK NOW
ENERGY
WHAT
IT IS SEPARATING THE MAGNET
THAT THE MAGNET IS MOVING ON- ON THE BOTTOM OF THE FIXED STACK BUT THE PAPER CLIP ISN'T
NOW WHEN IT GETS TO 19 WASHERS THEN MAGNETISM BREAKS
BREAKS THE MAGNETS APART
<NO_SIGNAL>
THAT +UH+ THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS BRINGING THE MAGNET WAY FROM THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE THERE'S MORE WEIGHT IN B BUCKET OR BOTTLE AND +UH+ IT HAS MORE WEIGHT THAN +UH+ +UM+ THE MAGNETIC FORCE IN BOTTLE A
THE MAGNETITE FORCE IS BRINGING THEM TOGETHER IS
I DON’T KNOW
THE SPACERS ARE TRYING TO SEPARATE THE MAGNETS
I DON’T KNOW
THAT THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPER TO THE TOUCH THE +UH+ METAL CLIP AND THE METAL CLIP IS MOVING THE MAGNET AROUND
THAT THEY ARE BEING BROKEN TOGETHER
WASHERS I THINK THAT IS
HOW MANY TIMES DO I NEED TO SAY THAT
THAT THE MAGNETS ARE BEING SEPARATED
THAT THE FORCE IS BRINGING THE MAGNETS TOGETHER WHICH THE MAGNET- MAGNETS ARE GOI- THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GOING TO THE MAGNETS YOU KNOW THROUGH THE SPACERS FOR THE MAGNETIC FORCE TO TOUCH THE OTHER MAGNET
TO PUT MORE WASHERS INTO OTHER BOTTLE <SIDE_SPEECH> I DON’T KNOW
I DON’T KNOW
NOW WHEN THE WASHERS GET TO 19 +UH+ THE MAGNETISM BREAKS AND +UH+ THE MAGNETS +UH+ THE MAGNET A DOESN’T STICK TO THE OTHER MAGNET
TO HAVE NINE SPACERS BRING THE MAGNETS APART
ENERGY
THAT BATTERIES NOT LIGHTING AND
THAT THE OTHER BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
THAT THE FLOW WILL NOT CONTINUE
I DON'T
THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY WILL NOT WORK
A SERIES CIRCUIT
THAT THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY +OH+
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THAT ONE YOU ON +AH+ THAT THE BATTERIES AND THE LIGHT BULB IS BURNING OUT IN THE AND YOU HAD TO REPLACE ANYONE AND AND THE BATTERY THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT AGAIN
THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS ONLY ONE
THAT THE SWITCHES NOT TOUCHING THE WIRES SO THAT LIGHT BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
THAT THE FILAMENT BROKEN THE LIGHT BULB IS NOT LIGHT
BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS A CIRCUIT
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE THEN IT WON'T BURN OUT QUICKLY
THAT THE FILAMENT BREAKS AND THE ELECTRICITY STOPS MOVING AND- AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THE ELECTRICITY WILL KEEP FLOWING AND FLOW
IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
I DON'T KNOW
THAT THE FILAMENTS BREAKS AND THEN IF YOU REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER BATTERY +UH+ LIGHT BULB +UH+ IT WILL BURN OUT AND THE FILAMENT WILL BREAK
THAT WHEN ONE FILAMENT BREAKS +UH+ THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WILL STILL KEEP CONTINUING
THAT THE BULBS ARE BURNING OUT
GOOD
THE SERIES CIRCUIT ONLY HAVE ONE PATHWAY
CAN YOU REPEAT
BECAUSE THE LIGHT BULB IS BROKEN
THAT THE OTHER BULB WILL NOT LIGHT
BYE
AFTER THE +UM+ FILAMENT BREAKS
THAT THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY WILL NOT WORK
THAT EVERYTHING STOPS WORKING
IT BREAKS A- IT BREAKS A LIGHT BULB
THAT CARRIES IS LIKE A MAGNETISM FORCE SO THAT CAN CARRY WASHERS AND OTHER METAL STUFF
THAT ONE IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT THE ELECTRICITY DOESN’T FLOW TO THE RIVET SO THE LIKE OTHER RIVET CAN CARRY A WASHERS OR ANY METAL STUFF
THAT IS THIS ELECTROMAGNET IT UP AND IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS FROM THE SIDE
<SILENCE>
YEAH
IF THE SWITCH IS CLOSED BECAUSE +HM+ THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO THE SWITCH AND THE SWITCH PRODUCES THE ELECTRICITY TO THE RIVETS AND IF IT’S OPEN IT DOESN’T PRODUCE ELECTRICITY TO THE RIVET
RIBBON
THE RIVET THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
THAT THE ELECTRIC-ELECTROMAGNET PICKED UP THE WASHERS WHEN IT’S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
THAT THE (*) RIVET ARE IS OR IS ELECTROMAGNET NOW SO IT CAN CARRY METAL STUFF WATER AND IT’S PRODUCING ELECTRICITY FROM THE D-CELL TO THAT MAKE IT A ELECTROMAGNET
SO PRODUCES A ELECTRICITY
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
REPEAT THAT PLEASE
THAT THERE ARE WIRES WRAPPED AROUND THE RIBBON AND THE WASHERS WILL PRODUCE A LIKE- WILL STICK TO THE RIBBON
IT’S STARTS THE PICKUP WASHERS
<NO SIGNAL>
+UM+ ENERGY
THAT THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
NOW WHEN IT IS A CLOSED CIRCUIT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THAT CIRCUIT A CLOSED CIRCUIT TO THE RIVET AND IT BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D-CELL
THAT’S SO BE WRAPPED AROUND THIS WIRES TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY ALSO THE RIVET CAN BE ELECTROMAGNET
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THAT ONE IT IS IN OPEN CIRCUIT THE ELECTRO THE RIVET PUT DOWN THE WASHERS BUT WHEN IT’S A CLOSED CIRCUIT IT PICKS UP THE WASHERS AGAIN AND I AM TALKING LOUD ENOUGH FOR IT MIGHT BEEN A LOWER QUIT
<SIDE_SPEECH>
<NO_SIGNAL>
YOU NEED TO +UH+ WRAP IT ROUND THE ELECTROMAGNET
A CLOSEDCIRCUIT
<NO SIGNAL>
<NO SIGNAL>
ELECTRICITY
THAT OF THE ELECTROMAGNET ALL CAN CARRY (*)
THAT IS NOT ELECTROMAGNET ANY MORE
THEY ALL PRODUCE ELECTRICITY
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
<NO SIGNAL>
<NO SIGNAL>
<NO_SIGNAL>
BECAUSE THAT WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS TO THAT WHAT IT CALLED RIVET AND THE WASHER OR IN THE RIVET PICKS UP THE WASHERS
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
IT IS CLOSED
BYE
THE BULBS WON'T BE THAT +AH+ THAT DIM
THAT THEY KEEP CHANGING
BETTER THAN YOU
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
TO BRING POWER TO THE WHATEVER BY YOU TRYING TO POWER UP
I DON'T KNOW
<NO_SIGNAL>
THAT THE D-CELLS DON'T CARRY THE ENERGY PROPERLY
OKAY
ENERGY
OUT THE LIGHT BULB AND THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING THROUGH TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND +AH+ POWERING UP ALL THE LIGHT BULBS AGAIN
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND TOWARDS THE BATTERY BACK TO NEGATIVE SIDE
THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT MORE
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
THAT BULB +UM+ ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE +UM+ BATTERY GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY WHICH IS THAT THE POSITIVE SIDE
ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE D-CELL GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB TO POWERED UP IN BACK THROUGH THE WHERE END OF D
PUTTING BOTH OF THE POSITIVE SIDES TOGETHER BECAUSE THE ENERGY WON'T BE ABLE TO FLOW THAT
THE ENERGY TO GO DIRECTLY TO LIGHT BULB AND BACK MAKE A LIGHT
BECAUSE THE POSITIVE SIDE NEEDS TO BE +UM+ ON OF FLIP DOWN ROD ONE BATTERY AND THAT PART OF NEGATIVE SIDE NEEDS THE KINETIC ENERGY THROUGH THE +UM+ LIGHT BULB AND OFF THAT LIGHT BULB AND GOING TO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE A LIGHT +AH+ BACK TO THE BATTERY TO POWER UP MAKE THE ENERGY KEEP FLOWING
THAT THE NEGATIVE SIDE CARRIES THE ENERGY TO THE BOTH THE LIGHT BULBS AND GOES BACK TO THE THE POSITIVE SIDE GOING THROUGH THE BOTH OF THE BATTERIES
FROM THE BATTERY TO THE FILAMENT THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB FILAMENT TO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB FILAMENT BACK TO THE BATTERY
I DON'T KNOW
BY MAKING THE NEGATIVE SIDE MAKE CARRY THE ENERGY THROUGH THE LIGHT BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULBS BACK +AH+ BACK TO THE +UM+ POSITIVE SIDE
THAT WE NEED TWO BATTERIES INSTEAD OF ONE TO POWER UP BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULB
THAT THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE PATHWAYS IN THE SERIES AND INSTEAD OF ONE
THAT THE LIGHT BULBS WERE LIGHTER
THEY ARE ON THE FIRST (*) +UM+  TWO BATTERIES THAT CAN PUTTING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS
THAT'S THE ENERGY IS GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB TO POWER THAT WHAT HAPPEN THE OTHER ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO THE LIGHT BULB MAIN POWERING THAT ONE
<NO_SIGNAL>
ONE
THAT THEY ARE POWERING UP THE LIGHT BULB
THAT THEY ARE BOTH LIGHT IT
THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE D-CELL
THAT THERE IS ONLY
<BREATH> TO
<NO_SIGNAL>
THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING +AH+ THROUGH ONE LIGHT BULB THEY GOING DOWN AND GOING UP THROUGH THE OTHER LIGHT BULB GOING BACK TO THAT POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D-CELL
I DON'T KNOW
CAN YOU REPEAT
THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH ONE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO POWER UP THE LIGHT BULB AND GOING BACK TO THE WIRE IN GOING BACK TO THE D-CELL
<NO_SIGNAL>
WHAT DO YOU SAY
THE POSITIVE SIDE
I DON'T KNOW
THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THAT THERE IS NOT ONE BUT THERE IS
I DON'T KNOW
THAT EACH LIGHT BULB WOULD HAVE IT WONT LIGHT
I'M DOING GOOD
THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE PATHWAY THROUGH THE WHOLE CIRCUIT
THAT THAT LIGHT BULBS OR MORE BRIGHT THEN THE ONES ON THE THE ONE ON THE
THAT THEY ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THAT POWERS THE MORE OF IT GOING BACK TO THE D
I DON'T KNOW
THAT THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT MORE WHATEVER YOU ARE TRYING TO I DON'T
THAT THEY ARE MORE BRIGHT THAN THE OTHER ONES
WHAT DO YOU SAY
ENERGY
PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THAT THE LIGHT BULB IS KEEPS IT BURNING OUT
DOWN
IT'S UP
I DON'T KNOW YOU TELL ME
UPS
I DON'T KNOW
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
THE SUN LIGHT IS HELPING THAT THAT LITTLE THING WORK FOR THE MOTOR
IT WOULN'T WORK
IT'S GIVES A IT GIVES THAT POWER SOURCE POWER
+UM+ THE PERSON HE DID IT PUT ANOTHER PLACE AND SO NOW THROUGH
THINK WHENEVER I CLICK IT +UM+ IT MOVES AND IT GIVES POWER AND NO NO MORE
THIS QUESTIONS ARE HARD
+UM+ THE BAD THE D-CELL IS CONNECTED TO THE WIRES AND THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR AND THAT ENERGY SOURCES GOING THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR
+UM+ IT'S SEND ALL ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR AROUND IN THE MOTOR ROUND BACK TO THE WIRE AND BACK INTO THE D-CELL AND IT KEEPS FLOWING AND FLOWING AND FLOWING
METAL HAS TO BE CONNECTED NOT DISCONNECTED
IT GIVES IT GIVES SOME THE SOURCE POWER
<NO_SIGNAL>
IT HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO THE THING
IT DOESN'T SPEND
METAL
WORKS
GIVES POWER AND AN ENERGY SOURCE
I MEAN SOME POWER HAS TO GO FROM THE WIRES ON TO THE THING TO MAKE IT HAVE POWER
YOU TOO
+UM+  IT'S NOT CONNECTED RIGHT SO IT'S NOT WORKING
THE BACKGROUND CHANGES AND THE SUN MAKES IT TOWARD THE CLOUDY DAY GOES AWAY (*) WHEN YOU WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT THE SUN RISES AND WORKS
THE SWITCH HAS TO BE DOWN
IT DOESN’T WORK
IT'S MOVING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S GIVING HIS POWER
HOUR
IT MEANS +UM+ THE POWER SOURCES GOING THROUGH THE WIRE
IT'S WORKING AND THE FLAG IS TO
THE POWER AND THE WIRES
+UM+ WE HAVE BEEN +UM+ WE BEEN MAKING A LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP AND MAKING A MOTOR RUN BY WIRES AND
<SILENCE>
SWITCH HAS TO BE DOWN AND EVERYTHING HAS TO BE CONNECTED THE RIGHT WAY
<NO_SIGNAL>
+UM+ WELL WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY LEARNED ABOUT SOME YEAR BECAUSE THE POWER THAT WE GOT DELAYED BY THE SNOW
+UM+ WELL THERE IS NO POWER SOURCE STOPER SO I THINK THE TEM THE TEMPLATE GETS GETS ON PUT IN AND THE WIRES IS GO OUT INTO THE FLAG
+UM+ I THINK I MEAN THE SWITCHES TO BE DOWN FOR THE
I SEE THE BULBS TURNING ON AND OFF EVERYTIME I CLICK
UM THERE'S ELECTRICITY FLOWING IN TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS ONE FOR EACH BULB THEREFORE IF ONE BURNS OUT BOTH ONE WILL STILL STAY ON AS OPPOSED TO IN SERIES CIRCUIT WHERE THEY BOTH GO OUT IF ONE GOES OUT
IN MY OPINION I THINK A PARALLEL CIRCUIT WOULD BE BETTER IN A LONG STRING OF LIGHTS SO THAT IN CASE ONE GOES OUT THERE'S STILL PLENTY LEFT THAT ARE ON
I THINK THAT THE FIRST BULB WILL SHINE BRIGHTLY BUT THE REST OF THE BULBS WILL SHINE DIMLY AND IN THE CASE OF ONE BULB GOING OUT THEY WILL ALL GO OUT
THE LIGHTS TURN OFF AND YEAH THAT'S ABOUT IT
THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULB AND IF THE BULB ISN'T WORKING THEN IT CAN'T TRAVEL THROUGH AND IT CAN'T THE ELECTRICITY CANNOT POWER THE NEXT BULB
I OBSERVE WHERE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING INSIDE THE BULBS
IF ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE POWER DOESN'T FLOW TO THE NEXT BULB IN LINE AND IT CANNOT COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT
IF I CLICK ON A BULB IT BURNS OUT BUT SINCE ITS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT ME MEANING THAT EACH BULB HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY IT CAN STI- ONE BULB CAN STILL STAY ON TURNED ON
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE BULB BURNS OUT IS THAT THE OTHER BULB WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP GOING BECAUSE IT'S ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PATHWAY MEANING THAT THERE WON'T BE ANY OBSTRUCTIONS TO THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
NO WE HAVE NOT YET
WHAT'S GOING ON IS THAT IN THE BULB THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND WHEN IT BURNS OUT THAT MEANS THAT ONE OF THE WIRES BREAKS INSIDE THE BULB SO IT DOESN'T GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE OTHER BULB
IT DOESN'T COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT AND THE OTHER BULB DOES NOT LIGHT
N NOT A WHOLE LOT ALL THAT WE'VE REALLY BEEN DOING RECENTLY IS THE LAST THING WE DID IN SCIENCE WAS MAKING ELECTROMAGNET THEN BEFORE THAT WE MADE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T TRAVEL THROUGH THAT BULB THAT BURNS OUT AND THE OTHER BULB CAN'T GET ITS POWER AND THEN THE CIRCUIT'S NOT COMPLETED AND BOTH BULBS GO OUT
WE'VE BEEN WORKING MAINLY WITH SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS COURSE JUST TODAY WE WORKED WITH ELECTROMAGNETS
NO YES I AM FAMILIAR WITH A BALANCE CAN YOU EVEN HEAR ME OH MY GOD IT'S STILL ON
BECAUSE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONTRASTED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
MY PREDICTION WAS RIGHT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WEIGHED MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
SO NUMBER ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN NUMBER TWO NUMBER THREE IS MORE CONCENTRATED TO NUMBER TWO AND NUMBER ONE IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN NUMBER THREE SO OVERALL NUMBER THREE IS THE MOST CONTRASTED THAN NO NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONTRASTED THAN NUMBER THREE AND THEN NUMBER TWO IS THE MOST DILUTE
NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED NUMBER TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
YOU CAN TELL IF IT'S MORE CONCENTRATED IF UM IT'S DARKER
THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS SO THE ROCK WEIGHS EIGHTY EIGHT MORE GRAMS THAN THE FEATHER
NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONTRASTED AND THEN NUMBER TWO IS THE IS THE MOST DILUTED
I THINK THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
<NO_SIGNAL>
BAD
NUMBER TWO
UM THE THE FARTHER YOU GO TO THE RIGHT THE MORE CONTRASTED YOU AND THE FARTHER YOU GO TO THE LEFT THE MORE DILUTED THEY
THE GRAPE THING THE ONE TO THE LEFT IS MORE CONCENTRATED AND THE SALT WATER WATER ONES ARE
YES I AM I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH A MEASURE WEIGHTS WHAT WHAT DID YOU JUST GET LOGGED ON DID YOU FORGET THE PASSWORD
BY THEIR WEIGHT
IT MAKES THE THINGS MORE CONTRASTED
THEY BOTH HAVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITERS OF WATER IN IT AND THE FIRST ONE HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE IN IT AND THE SECOND ONE HAS (()) GRAMS OF SOLUTE IN IT
THE FIRST ONE HAS TEN THE MIXTURE ON THE RIGHT HAS UM HAS HAS MORE SOLUTE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
WE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
UM THE WATER CAN HOLD FOUR SCOOPS OF CITRIC ACID BUT ONLY THREE SCOOPS OF EPSOM SALT
CHEMICAL REACTIONS
UM IT'S ABOUT THE LIMITS ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN HOLD STUFF
BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT DENSITY STUFF
GOOD
THEY'RE REACHING THEIR LIMITS OF HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD IN THE WATER
SOLUTION A IS A IS IS IS IS IS IS SALT YOU CAN FIGURE THAT OUT BY DRAINING IT AND SEEING WHAT IT IS
(()) PARTS FOR THIS SOLUTION AND THE CHEMICAL REACTION
SUBSTANCE NUMBER ONE
I THINK THAT THEY'RE ADDING ENOUGH SALT TO MAKE THE WATER REACH THE LIMIT ABOUT HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
DENSITY YEAH AND AND SATURATE
THE SATURATION OF THE WATER
YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER
HOW DENSE THEY ARE
SOLUTE
UM THEY UM GO THEY UM THE ONE THE FARTHER TO THE RIGHT THE MORE CONCENTRATED IT GETS
THE TASTE IS NOT AS THICK I GUESS
WONDERFUL
THE DIFFERENCE IS THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS LESS PURPLE STUFF THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS LESS PURPLE STUFF
I THINK THE ONE WITH THE MORE GRAPE POWDER WILL TASTE MORE LIKE GRAPE AND THE OTHER ONE WILL TASTE MORE LIKE WATER THAN GRAPE
THAT UM THE MORE THE MORE SOLUTE YOU ADD TO THE SOLVENT THE MORE CONCENTRATED IT IS
WELL LIKE WELL UM AN UM UM THE FIRST ONE IT UM HAS MORE WATER SO IT IS LESS CONCENTRATED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT WHICH HAS LESS WATER WHICH IS MORE CONCENTRATED
THE UM THE LIGHTER ONE IS HAS UM IS LESS CONCENTRATED AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONCENTRATED
I THINK THE UM ONE WITH LESS GRAPE POWDER WILL TASTE MORE LIKE WATER
WE BEEN STUDYING SOLUTIONS
WELL I THINK THE ONE THE HIGHER CONCENTRATED ONES WILL HAVE A TASTE THAT HAS MORE FLAVOR
YOU ADD MORE OR LESS WATER MARTIE
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T ADD AS MUCH SOLUTE THAT YOU DID TO THE SOLVENT SO THEY'RE LESS THEY'RE MORE DILUTED THEY ARE DILUTED
A SOLVENT
THE LIGHTER COLORED SOLUTIONS ARE UM MORE DILUTED
UM YOU CAN ADD MORE OR LESS WATER
BYE MARTIE
BY THEIR COLOR
TWO SOLUTIONS ARE BEING MADE
TASTE
I NOTICED THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS MORE SO THE THE IT'S DARKER AND THE LEFT IS HAS LESS SO IT'S LIGHTER
IT IS A SOLUTION
YES
I SAW THAT THE SAND I THINK WENT STAYED ON THE TOP OF THE FILTER WHEN THE WATER AND SALT WENT THROUGH
WE CAN SEPARATE MIXTURES BY USING MAGNETS FILTERS AND EVAPORATION
OKAY
THE ONE I PICKED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT'S BEST FOR EVAPORATING TO MAKE SALT CRYSTALS
I NOTICED THAT NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET
I NOTICED THAT THE OTHER STUFF WHEN IT WENT THROUGH THE SIEVE AND I AND I THINK WE USED THE UM SEAM BECAUSE UM THE THE THINGS THE MATERIALS WITH THE BIG PARTICLE SIZE UM WILL STAY ON THE TOP INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH WITH THE REST OF THE STUFF
I NOTICED THAT THE SIEVE STAYED ON TOP OF THE UM THE FILTER WHEN THE OTHERS THINGS WENT DOWN
WE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
I AM GOOD
THINK WE USED UM A DIFFERENT THING BECAUSE THERE ARE PAPER CLIPS WHICH HAVE MAGNETITE IN THEM SO THEY WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET INSTEAD OF JUST STAYING WITH OTHERS
NO
BECAUSE THE STONES ARE BIGGER THAN THEIR PARTICLE SIZE IS BIGGER THAN THE HOLES IN THE SEAM THING WHATEVER YOU SAID
THE ROCKS ARE STAYING ON TOP BECAUSE UM BECAUSE UM THEIR PARTICLE SIZE IS BIGGER THAN THE HOLE
PARTICLE SIZE AND UM MAGNET MAGNETS
SURE IT TWO TWO THINGS THAT KEEP THEIR PROPERTY
THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNETISM
THAT MEANS WELL MAKING THE WATER NOT UM GO UM WELL IT'S JUST MAKING THE WATER DISAPPEAR TO MAKE THE SALT COME
DON'T GO MARNI BYE
I NOTICED THAT THE PAPER CLIPS WENT WITH THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETITE IN THEM
DIFFERENT UM WE USE DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR DIFFERENT MIXTURES BECAUSE EACH MIXTURE HAS DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES
PARTICLE SIZE AND MAGNETISM
I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE BUT I BUT I THINK WE USE THE FILTER BECAUSE THE STUFF STAYED ON TOP
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT EVAPORATING UM USING A FILTER AND A SEAM AND USING MAGNETISM TO GET MAGNETITE THINGS WITH MAGNETITE OUT OF THE MIX
PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN IS PARTICLE SIZE
THE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GOING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETISM
THEY BOTH HAVE TO WEIGH SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS
UM THE SALT SOLUTION WITH FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER WEIGHS MORE THAN THE WATER WITH FIFTY MILLILITERS BECAUSE THE SALT ADDED SOME WEIGHT
WE UM USED LITTLE GRAM GRAMS TO HELP US WEIGH HOW MUCH HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS
THE UM AMOUNT OF WATER HAS REACHED THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD IN
THE SOLUTE THE SOLUTE UM SALT HAD WEIGHED SEVENTEEN POUNDS WHICH MADE THE SOLUTION WEIGH MORE SEVENTEEN GRAMS
I DON'T KNOW
(())
UM YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A SOLUTION
UM EACH TIME YOU ADD MORE SALT THE WATER GETS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER AND UM IT IT UM HAS LEFT OVER SALT FROM THE BOTTOM
REACHED THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU HELP ME
I DON'T KNOW PLEASE HELP ME
THEY ARE TOOLS TO MAKE A SOLUTION
I DON'T KNOW
UM YOU ADDED THREE SCOOPS AND IT CAN NOT IT CAN NOT HOLD THAT MUCH SALT SO SOME OF IT SINKS TO THE BOTTOM IN A SOLID FORM
IT'S FOGGY AND THERE'S IT'S ALL BLENDED INTO
OKAY
IT'S BEING THE SOLUTE IS BEING ADDED INTO THE SOLVENT UNTIL THE SOLVENT CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE SOLUTE
UM IN IN CUP ONE CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND BAKING SODA WERE MIXED CUP TWO CALCIUM AND CITRIC ACID WERE MIXED AND IN CUP THREE BAKING SODA AND CITRIC ACID WERE MIXED AND NOTHING
THE CITRIC HYDROX AND HYDROX ACID ARE ADDED TO FIFTEEN MILLILITERS WATER WHICH FORMS A SOLUTION
IT IS NOT A REACTION BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTANT TO BE ADDED
NO I DON'T THINK A CHEMICAL REACTION IS BEING FORMED
WELL THERE ARE NO BUBBLES AND THERE WAS NO CHEMICAL REACTION BUT WHEN THEY ADDED TOGETHER THEY THE SOLUTION WAS PURPLE
THE ICE CUBES ARE FLOATING TO THE TOP BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS DENSE AND THEN THE WATER IS GETTING FOGGY
YES A CHEMICAL REACTION IS BEING FORMED CAUSE ADD THE WATER AS THE WATER AND SNOW ARE BEING ADDED TO THE BIKE A IT'S CAUSING RUST WHICH IS A CHEMICAL REACT
RECENT
YES BECAUSE OF THE (()) OF (())
THE CARBON CARBONATED WATER WAS ADDED TO THE CUP AND AS IT WAS BEING POURED IT WAS FIZZING AND THEN AFTER A WHILE IT STOPPED FIZZING
CHEMICAL REACTION
A LOT OF THEM KEEP THEIR SAME PRODUCT
BYE
I DON'T KNOW PLEASE HELP ME
THE GLOW STICK IS BEING GLOWED WHEN HE WHEN YOU FOLD IT
A CHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT MORE THAN ONE REACTANTS TO BE ADDED TOGETHER
WELL THE ONE TO THE LEFT IS ACID THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS CALCIUM
I DON'T KNOW HELP ME
ONE CUP HAS NOTHING IN IT AND THE OTHER HAS WATER IN IT AND THEN THERE'S A SPOONFUL OF BAKING SODA AND A SPOONFUL OF CALCIUM CHLORIDE NOTHING IS MIXED TOGETHER SO THERE'S NO MIXTURE OR SOLUTION
A CHEMICAL REACTION IS NOT BEEN HAPPENED HERE BECAUSE NOTHING IS HAPPENING WHEN THE GRAPE TASTE IS ADDED TO THE WATER
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE NOTHING DID ANYTHING ONLY THE ICE CUBES WERE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER SO THEY FLOATED
I'M DOING AWESOME
YES THE UM SOLUTION HAS BLUE MOLECULES FROM THE VINEGAR AND WHITE MOLECULES FROM THE BAKING SODA AND GREEN MOLECULES WHICH REPRESENT GAS
I NOTICED THAT UM THE VINEGAR HAS BLUE AND YELLOW MOLECULES AND THE BAKING SODA HAS WHITE MOLECULES AND THE UM THE PRODUCTS HAS BLUE WHITE AND GREY MOLECULES
WE CALL THESE REACTANTS (())
A PRODUCT
A SOLVENT
THE ICE CUBES FLOATED TO THE TOP BECAUSE THEY WERE LESS DENSE AND THE THEIR WAS STUFF ON THE SIDES OF
WATER AND SNOW ARE BEING ADDED TO THE BIKE WHICH MAKES A CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH ADDS RUST TO THE BIKE
A CHEMICAL REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE WHEN THE TWO THINGS ARE ADDED IT BUBBLES
CONSERVATION
THE WATER IS GAINING UM MOLECULES FROM THE (()) ACID
I THINK A SOLVENT IS MISSING
THE TWO THINGS WERE ADDED TOGETHER WHICH MADE A CHEMICAL REACTION AND THEN THE THEY IT WENT BACK TO REGULAR CLEAR (())
NO BECAUSE TO HAVE A CHEMICAL REACTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE WATER
LEARNED ABOUT HOW TO TELL HOW IF CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE BEING FORMED OR NOT
THE TWO THINGS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER TO MAKE THEM
VINEGAR AND BAKING SODA WERE ADDED TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY WERE ADDED TOGETHER THEY CREATED A CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH BUBBLED
THE TWO SOLUTIONS MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THE THE SOLUTION BUBBLED
AS THE MONTHS PASSED DIFFERENT THINGS ARE BEING PUT ON THE BIKE FIRST THERE WAS RAIN WHICH AND THEN THERE WAS SNOW WHICH MADE THE BUS BIKE
THEY ALL LOOK DIFFERENT
SO THE BAKING SODA CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND WATER ARE BEING MIXED TOGETHER WHICH FORMS A CHEMICAL REACTION AND AFTER A LONG TIME UM PRECIPITATION IS LEFT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP
A CHEMICAL REACTION IS BEING MADE AS THE GLOW STICK IS UM FOLDED IN HALF
ALL OF THE MOLECULES IN THE DIFFERENT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT THE THE UM
SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN THE BAKING SODA OR SOLUTE WAS ADDED TO THE VINEGAR WHICH IS THE SOLVENT MADE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHICH CREATED UM GAS UH YEAH
REACTANTS
IT CAN BECAUSE EVERYTHING ON THE EARTH WILL ALWAYS BE ON THE EARTH AND NOTHING CAN DISAPPEAR OR BE MADE
WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
CAN BE SEPARATED
YES A CHEMICAL REACTION HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE BECAUSE WHEN YOU FOLD IT IN HALF IT LIGHTS UP WHICH INDICATES A CHEMICAL REACTION
REACTANT
IT JUST STAYS AT THE TOP
THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED CAUSE OF THEIR DENSITY
YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE THE BLUE HAS TWENTY TWELVE GRAMS THE GREEN HAS TWO GRAMS AND THE RED HAS SIX GRAMS AND THE BLUE'S AT THE BOTTOM WHICH HAS THE MOST AND GREEN'S AT THE TOP BECAUSE IT HAS THE LEAST GRAMS
THE CORK IS LESS DENSE THAN THE PENNY AND THE PENNY IS MORE DENSE THAN THE CORK
THEY HAVE MORE OF THE SOLUTE IN THEM SO THEY ARE MORE CONTRASTED OR MORE DENSE
THE MORE DENSE ONE WILL SINK THE
WELL WHEN YOU MIX TWO SOLUTION SALT SOLUTIONS TOGETHER ONE THAT THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENSE WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM AND THE ONE THAT'S LESS DENSE WILL GO TO THE TOP FLOAT
IF UM IF IF UM THE UM THING THAT YOU DROPPED IN THE WATER FLOATS TO THE TOP THEN IT'S LESS THAN IT'S LESS DENSE THAN THE THING THAT FLOAT SINKS
SO SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN SOLUTION B BECAUSE THE GRAM WENT TO THE BOTTOM AND THEN THE B WENT TO THE TOP
SEE YOU THURSDAY
IT SAYS THAT THE BLUE IS TWELVE GRAMS WHEN THE GREEN IS TWO GRAMS SO IT HAS TEN MORE GRAMS THAN IT
IN SOLUTION THEY WOULD SINK AND IN SOLUTION B THEY WOULD FLOAT
ONE THE LESS DENSE ONE GOES STAYS TO THE TOP THE ONE THAT I'VE ALREADY DONE THAT THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENSE WILL
THEIR DENSITY CAME THE THEIR DENSITY BECAME THE SAME
THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENSE WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM AND THE ONE THAT'S LESS DENSE WILL GO TO THE
BECAUSE THE THE HEAVIER ONE SUNK TO THE BOTTOM AND MIXED IN WITH THE LIGHTER ONE
BAD
I THINK THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN SOLUTION B
WE LEARNED ABOUT SATURATION
YOU CAN SAY THAT IT'S MORE CONTRASTED
UM BECAUSE THE LESS DENSE ONE WAS AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN THE MORE DENSE ONE SUNK INTO THE LESS DENSE ONE TO MAKE THE THING THAT'S IN THE PICTURE
THE PILE TO THE LEFT IS A MIXTURE
CALL THAT A CRYSTAL
THEY'RE BRINGING MIX TOGETHER
THEY'RE TAKING BACK THEIR OWN PROPERTY
WE CALL THAT A SOLUTE
THE SALAD IS GREEN
THIS IS A MIXTURE WHERE EVERYTHING KEEPS THEIR PROPERTIES
THE SAND STAYED ON TOP
BECAUSE THE GREY STUFF UM DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
THAT IS CALLED A SOLUTION
GOOD
THEY ALL KEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTIES
THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER WHILE THE OTHER TWO KEEP THEIR OWN PROPERTIES
SOLUTIONS CAN'T BE SEPARATED BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS DISSOLVED AND THE OTHER AND IT CAN'T BE TAKEN OUT
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURE
THEY WERE TAKING RAISINS AND M&MS OUT OF THE NUTS
THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND TO SO THE WATER STAYS THE SAME
TO MAKE A SOLUTION ONE ONE PART NEEDS TO DISSOLVE INTO THE OTHER
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MIXTURE AND A SOLUTION IS THAT A SOLUTION ONE DISSOLVES AND IN A MIXTURE BOTH OF THEM KEEP THEIR SAME PROPERTIES
BYE
THE UM SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
THE MIX THE UM EVERYTHING MIXES TOGETHER TO MAKE A MIXTURE
SCREEN IS SEPARATING THE WATER FROM THE SAND
I SEE A SALAD NUTS AND WATER
IT'S CALLED A MIXTURE AND IT'S WHERE TWO OR MORE OBJECTS ARE TOGETHER
THEY'RE STRAINING THE MARBLES OUT OF THE WATER
THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER
THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP WHILE THE WATER GOES THROUGH
THE WATER GETS STRAINED OUT OF THE MIXTURE
I DON'T KNOW
THE SALT AND WATER IS A SOLUTION AND THE OTHER TWO ARE MIXTURES
WE CALL THE THING THAT'S DISSOLVES IS A SOLUTE
THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY BEFORE THE SALT THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN AND THE SOLUTIONS WEIGHS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS AFTER THE TWO THINGS ARE MIXED
THAT IS A SOLVENT
THE MASS IS GROWING
IT IS BEING EVAPORATED
THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER
I NOTICE THAT THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND THEN WHEN THE WATER EVAPORATES THE SALT TURNS INTO SALT CRYSTALS
YOU CAN EVAPORATE THE WATER TO MAKE SALT CRYSTALS
A SOLUTION
THE WATER IS BEING EVAPORATED
WE'VE FOUND THAT A WAY TO SEPARATE A SOLUTE IS TO EVAPORATE THE SOLVENT
I NOTICE THAT THE SALT IN THE THE SALT DOES NOT GET FILTERED OUT IT JUST RUNS THROUGH WITH THE WATER
THE SOLVENT IS THE IS THE WATER AND IT WILL DISSOLVE THE SALT IN THIS
THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MAKES THE
THEY ARE MIXING ONE INGREDIENT INTO THE WATER TO MAKE A MIXTURE OR A SOLUTION
I NOTICE THAT NEITHER THE WATER OR THE SALT LOSES ANY MASS
(()) THE SOLVENT OUT OF THE SOLUTION
FILTER OUT THE SOLUTE IN A MIXTURE BUT NOT IN A SOLUTION
IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
(())
IT'S A GOOD WAY TO SEPARATE THEM
IT IS IT IS CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
TIME
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEPARATING MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
THE CANDY IS TEN GRAMS THE RAISINS ARE TWENTY THE NUTS ARE TWENTY AND ALL TOGETHER THE MIXTURE IS FIFTY GRAMS AND IT HAS ALL THE INGREDIENTS THAT WE ADDED INTO IT
THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE IS A SOLUTION AND THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE IS A MIXTURE
BYE
THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS A MIXTURE
GOOD
I DON'T KNOW
I SEE THAT THE WATER WEIGHS FIFTY GRAMS THE SALT WEIGHS FIFTEEN GRAMS AND THEN WHEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER IT WEIGHS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
SOLUTE IS WHERE ONE INGREDIENT THE SOLVENT DISSOLVES ANOTHER INGREDIENT SOLUTE INTO THE SOLVENT
YES
THIS IS A MIXTURE
THE TOP ONE IS A MIXTURE AND THE BOTTOM ONE IS A SOLUTION
THAT THE SOLUTE DISSOLVED INTO THE SOLVENT TO MAKE A SOLUTE SOLUTION
THE (()) THE (())
THEY KEEP THEY'RE SAME MASS
IT IS THE SOLUTE
WE CALL IT A SOLVENT
I DON'T KNOW
I NOTICE THAT THE SOLUTE DOES NOT GET FILTERED OUT OF THE SOLVENT
I DON'T KNOW
THIS IS A MIXTURE AND THE (()) STAYS ON TOP BECAUSE OF IT'S PARTICLE (())
IT TELLS YOU THAT THINGS DON'T LOSE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH
I SEE THAT THE SOLUTE IN THE MIXTURE STAYS IN THE COFFEE FILTER WHEN THE SOLVENT THE WATER RUNS THROUGH BACK INTO THE CUP
THE SALT IS DISSOLVING INTO THE WATER
GOOD
FOR EXAMPLE LIKE UM THE EARTH ITS HAS LIKE HUMAN ANIMALS PLANTS ALL LIVING THINGS AND
BECAUSE IT HAS SUBSYSTEMS
IT'S PART OF ITS UM
UM IT'S LIKE A RABBIT WELL EATS UM GRASS AND A SNAKE EATS THE RABBIT AND THE HAWK EATS THE BLUE JAY AND UM ALL THE LIVING THINGS EATS UP THE BACTERIA
I SEE UM LAND BLUE SKY MOUNTAINS TREES HOUSES
UM IT'S IT'S GOING THE GREEN IS LIVING PLANTS AND THE BLUE IS THE OCEAN
A CAR HAS LIKE UM AN ENGINE WHEELS A STEERING WHEEL SEATS WINDOWS
A HEART A KIDNEY AND A
ABOUT THE PARTS OF IT
UM I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THE BIOSPHERE BECAUSE LAND HAS LIVING THINGS ON IT AND WATER HAS LIVING THINGS LIVING
IT'S UM LAND AND OCEAN
AN ECOSYSTEM IS ALL LIVING THINGS
UM IT'S ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY
UM IT'S LIKE UM WATER LAND PEOPLE ANIMALS ALL LIVING THINGS
LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS
THERE ARE
IT'S BODY PARTS
BIOSPHERE IS UM ALL LIVING THINGS
BECAUSE IT'S UM A BIGGER PART OF A A SUB SUBSYSTEM
THE ARROWS ARE SHOWING WHAT THEY LIKE EAT LIKE OR WHAT AND WHAT THEY ARE RELATED TO
+AH+ IT'S NOT MOVING
<SIDE_SPEECH>
I DON'T KNOW IS IT MELTING YEAH I'M NOT SURE REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING
THE WAX MELTS
I SEE CANDLE I THINK IT’S THE FIRE
WE HAVE BEEN USING DIFFERENT OBJECTS TO SEE IF THEY WERE WORKING AS A CIRCUIT
AND THE FIRE BRINGING IS PROOF THAT THE ENERGY IS PRESENT
IT GOT WARM
DOING FINE HOW ARE YOU
ENERGY HELPS US
IT RELATES BECAUSE IT'S A SYSTEM
IS BECAUSE IT HAS INTERACTING PARTS MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE A SYSTEM
YEAH TO MOVE AND TO WORK TOGETHER
IT IS AND INTERACTING OF MOVING PARTS TOGETHER MAKING A CAR
ECOSYSTEM LIKE (())
THE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR ANIMALS AND THE ANIMALS ARE EATING
UM THEY ARE PRODUCING A SUBSYSTEM OF THE EARTH
SEE THIS I SEE THIS MOUNTAIN LOOKING THING AND IT HAS FOUR SYSTEMS
ARE FOUR
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WEATHER
SYSTEMS
THE HEART AND THE EYES
THE PATH THAT ANIMALS PROCESS FOOD THAT MAKES THE OTHERS AND THEY EAT IT
IT HAS TO DO WITH SYSTEMS IS BECAUSE IT'S A HUMAN BODY THAT HAS SYSTEMS IN IT
GOOD
THEY HAVE NO PLANTS AND ANIMALS THEY HAVE NO PLANTS AND ANIMALS
IT HAS ALL KINDS OF PARTS THAT MOVE AND WORK TOGETHER
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL INTERACTING MOVEMENTS THAT CAN MOVE
THERE IS MOVING PARTS MOVING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE SYSTEM
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
I'M FINE
IT HAS INTERACTING PARTS MOVING TOGETHER AND IT IT HAS TO HAVE EVERYTHING IN IT TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT
IS A SYSTEM WITH INTERACTING PARTS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIG SYSTEM
A SYSTEMS BECAUSE IT'S A BIG INTERACTING PART MOVING TOGETHER
BYE
THEY MIGHT BE GOOD EXAMPLES IS BECAUSE THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE LIKE EVERYTHING IN ANYWHERE I THINK THEY'RE GOOD SYSTEMS BECAUSE THEY ALL ARE INTERACTING PARTS THAT MOVE TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE SYSTEM
I THINK BECAUSE WE'RE INTERACTING PARTS MOVING TOGETHER
ALL HAVE TO DO WITH SYSTEMS
CAUSE IT HAS BUNCH OF SUBSYSTEMS WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE
ABOUT SYSTEMS
IT IS A BUNCH OF INTERACTING PARTS WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE BIG SYSTEM
THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE ONE SYSTEM
I THINK THAT THESE ARE SYSTEMS
NO
IT COULD BE THE WIRES SO THAT THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH
(())
THE MOTOR DOESN'T RUN WHEN IT IS WHEN IT IS CLOUDY
THIS IS A CIRCUIT BOARD
IF THE FLAG IS TURNING THEN THE THEN THE SOLAR CELL IS
THE MOTOR
THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES
THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE FLAG IS MOVING
THE THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED
THE WHEN THE SUN IS OUT THE MOTOR RUNS BUT IF IT'S CLOUDY OR THERE'S NO SUN THE MOTOR WON'T RUN
THEY COLLECT ENERGY SO MOTORS AND OTHER THINGS CAN RUN
THE MOTOR WON'T RUN
THIS PICTURE IS SHOWING THE CIRCUIT OF THE
THE SOLAR CELL IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ENERGY
WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH
(())
I NOTICE THAT EVERY TIME THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE THE MOTOR STOPS AND EVERY TIME THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR RUNS
WHEN THERE'S NO SUN THERE IS WHEN THERE'S NO SUN THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
THE WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT
THE MOTOR DOES NOT RUN
BECAUSE THE SWITCH LETS THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH
WE HAVE LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND OTHER ENERGY SOURCES
THE MOTOR THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE FACING THE SUNLIGHT IN ORDER FOR THE MOTOR TO
THE BATTERY PROVIDES THE ENERGY
THE SOLAR CELL IS COLLECTING ENERGY FROM THE SUN AND TRANSFERRING THAT ENERGY TO KINETIC ENERGY TO POWER THE MOTOR
THE BATTERY IS IS TRANSFERRING THE ENERGY TO THE MOTOR BY USING THE WIRES AND THE AND THEN THE SINCE THE
WHEN THE MOTOR IS RUNNING I THINK THAT THE ENERGY IS BEING TRANSFERRED FROM STORED ENERGY TO KINETIC ENERGY
THE SWITCH IS OFF
GOOD
THEY BURN AND THEY GIVE LOT OF SMOKE
THE CANDLE IS BURNING AND SO THEREFORE THE WAX IS MELTING
WHEN WE BURNT THE GASOLINE IT WILL PRODUCE CARBON DIOXIDE CARBON DIOXIDE BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE IT’LL CREATE SMOG AND THAT’S MEAN THE AIR WILL BE BAD
THERE WAS NO SOUND
SINCE THE COAL AND GASOLINE BRING EMITS SMOKE IT’S BAD FOR ENVIRONMENT BUT THE SOLAR CELL AND A WIND TURBINE WILL NOT
THE SOLAR PANEL WILL DON’T GIVE UP ANY SMOKE BUT THE COAL AND THE GAS GIVES US SMOKE
THE GIRL IS USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE WALKS THEREFORE SHE WILL NEED ENERGY FROM THE APPLE TO EAT
IT HAS EVERYTHING FROM CARS TO TOASTERS
GOOD BYE
THE FLAME IS BURNING THEREFORE I WILL MAKE WAX MELT AND THE WICK IS BURNING
I SEE GIVING OF LIGHT AND HEATS AND IT MAKES AND THEREFORE AND MAKES THEREFORE IT MAKES CANDLE MELT <SILENCE>
THE NAME FOR NON-RENEWABLE FUELS IS FOSSIL FUELS
CANDLE APPLES WOOD AND SIX GALLONS OF FUEL
THE EVIDENCE OF THE ENERGY IS SHE IS USING SHE IS USING HER ENERGY FROM EATING THE APPLE TO TO KEEP HIKING UP THE MOUNTAIN
ONE IS LIQUID AND ANOTHER IS A SOLID
SINCE THE PERSON IS HITTING THEIR HANDS ON THE DRUMS IT’S MAKING SOUND
THAT’LL CREATE SMOG THAT IS BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENTS
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ALTERNATE ENERGY SOURCES
YOU IT WILL POLLUTE THE AIR AND AT ALL IT’LL RUN OUT IF YOU USE IT TOO MUCH
<NO_SIGNAL>
LIGHT
THEY WILL POLLUTE THE AIR THEY WILL POLLUTE THE EARTH THEY WILL POLLUTE THE EARTH
THEY WORK ON
THE SOLAR CELL DOESN’T EMIT SMOKE BUT THE GASOLINE DOES
COAL GAS AND OIL
THEY CAN BE USED FOREVER
IT GETS BLACK AND FOGGY
I SEE THE CANDLE BURNING AND THE WAX MELTING
NO
<NO_SIGNAL>
HENCE SMOKY

WE HAVE BEEN MAKING A ELECTRO MAGNETS AND FINDING OUT HOW THEY WORK
ELECTRICITY IMPORTANT MAGNETS
YOU HAVE TO WRAP IT AROUND A LOT
+BLAH+
ELECTRICITY MOVING
CLOSE SWITCH ON OPEN SWITCH OFF
TO MAKE IT WRAP TIGHTLY A LOT
+CLOSE+
GOOD
THAT THE TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE BULB BASING AND THE BULB
THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT ELECTRICITY FLOWING
THE ENERGY FLOWS TOWARD THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
THEY TRANSFER THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
ELECTRICITY IS GETTING STUCK BY THE
THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE
THEY USE THE D CELL BATTERY TO UM TO TO WIRE ENERGY THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND THEN THE FILAMENT UM EMITS ENERGY WHEN THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH IT MAKES HEAT THEREFORE WHEN THE WHEN IT'S HOT ENOUGH WHEN IT'S HOT ENOUGH IT GLOWS
THEY ARE THE POWER SOURCE UM TO LIGHT THE BATTERY TO NO LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB
I NOTICE THAT ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB BASE AND ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB CASING
THERE THEY ARE A BATTERIES UM WHICH IS THE UM THE BATTERY WHICH IS A POWER SOURCE UM THE WIRES WHICH TRANSFER THE ENERGY AND A LIGHT BULB WHICH UM SHOWS THE TRANSFER OF ENERGY
THE DIRECTION THAT THE ENERGY IS IS COMING IN IS FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE AND THE SIDE THAT THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE
IT MEANS THAT THE ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH AND THAT THE ENERGY IS BEING TRANSFERRED INTO LIGHT ENERGY INSTEAD OF STORED ENERGY
IT MEANS THAT IT RECEIVES THE ENERGY AND THEN TRANSFORMS IT INTO LIGHT
IT MEANS THAT THE WIRES ARE PATHWAY SO THAT ENERGY FROM THE D CELL CAN MOVE TO THE LIGHT BULB
ARE WIRES AND THEY THEY TRANSFER ENERGY FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB
I AM NOT SURE
MEANS THAT THE D CELL BATTERY IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST LIGHT A LIGHT BULB WITHOUT A SOURCE OF ENERGY
I SEE THAT THE I SEE THAT THE ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THAT IT'S AND THE LIGHT BULB IS LIGHTING UP
ELECTRICITY FLOWS IN FROM THE POSITIVE AND ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT FROM THE NEGATIVE
THE WIRE THE WIRES THE WIRES ARE TOUCHING UM THE BOTH ON THE BULB BOTTOM IS UM IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THEY DON'T LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH
WIRES CARRY ELECTRICITY IN THE CIRCUIT
A D CELL BATTERY PROVIDES ENERGY IN A CIRCUIT
THE WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO LET ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH AND THE OTHER END OF THE WIRE HAS TO GO HAS TO TOUCH THE BULB BASE BULB BASE AND THE BULB CASING CAUSE BOTH
I NOTICE THAT ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB CASING AND ONE OF THE WIRES IS TOUCHING THE BULB BASE
I'M GOOD TODAY AND I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUIT BOARDS AND HOW THEY WORK
THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE OF THE OF THE D CELL BATTERY IS IS WHERE THE ENERGY IS FLOWING OUT
LIGHT BULBS MAKE UM MAKE LIGHT BY USING A FILAMENT THE FILAMENT UM HEATS UP UNTIL IT'S HOT ENOUGH THAT IT GLOWS
IT WILL NOT WORK
THAT THE LIGHT BULB WORKS IN BOTH WAYS EITHER THOUGH THE THE SIDES ARE SWITCHED
A D CELL BATTERY
THE ENERGY FLOWS INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE ENERGY FLOWS OUT FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE
LIKE
IT SO VERY HOT
I SEE THAT CANDLE BURNING IN THE WAX MELTING
GOOD
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW ENERGY IS PRESENT
THE CANDLE MELTS
IT POWERS THE THINGS LIKE TOASTER AND COMPUTERS
THEY HAVE NO SOUND
NO
I’M GOOD
THERE’RE ARE MAGNETS AND THEY’RE LIKE DOUGHNUTS AND ONE OF THE PAIR STICKS TOGETHER AND THE REST ARE FLOATING
THE SIMILARITY OF MAGNETS ARE TO ATTRACT EACH OTHER ARE THAT THEY-
BECAUSE- BECAUSE THE COMPASS USE THE EARTH’S MAGNETIC FIELD
EARTH MAGNETIC FIELD
I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW MAGNETS DO STUFF
THEY WILL REPEL EACH OTHER
BECAUSE THERE IS A NORTH POLE AND SOUTH POLE
THEY WHEN THEY REPEL EACH OTHER THE POLES ARE SOUTH AND SOUTH
<NO_SIGNAL>
THIS PICTURE IS ABOUT THE COMPASS THAT USES THE EARTH’S MAGNETIC POLES
THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER BECAUSE OF POLES
THE MAGNETS ARE RAPPELLING EACH OTHER
THERE IS THICK STACK OF PAPER THE PAPERCLIP CANNOT GO THROUGH
THE MAGNET IS MAGNETIZING THE STEEL NAIL AND THE STEEL NAIL STICK TO THE PAPER
WHEN- WHEN THE MAGNETS ALWAYS HAVE A MAGNETIC FIELD SO IF THE OBJECT THIN ENOUGH MAGNETIC FIELD CAN GO THROUGH IT
THE MAGNETIC FIELDS GO THROUGH A PAPER THEREFORE MAKING THE PAPERCLIP THEREFORE MAKING THE PAPERCLIP STICK TO THE MAGNET
AND MAGNETS DUE TO THE MAGNETIC FIELDS SO IF THE OBJECT IS NOT A STEEL OR IRON OBJECTS CAN STICK TO THE MAGNETS
<NO_SIGNAL>
IT WORKED THICK
THE FIRST THIN STACK THE POWER CAN GO THROUGH IT BUT WITH THE THICK STACK IT CAN’T
WE LEARNED ABOUT MAGNETS AND MAGNETIC FIELDS AND THAT STUFF
LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS AND OTHER STUFF
GOOD
THE THINK STACK IT WILL GOES THROUGH WAS A THICK STACK IT WON’T GO
AND THE THIN STACK IS CAN GO THROUGH THE WHOLE THING WHILE THE FORCE IN THE THINK STACK CAN ONLY GO THROUGH SOME PAPER
THESE OBJECTS ARE METALS
THE OBJECT THAT INSULATORS DON’T WORK WITH THE CIRCUIT AND THE AND THE CONDUCTORS ARE METALS AND THE INSULATORS ARE NOT METALS
ALL METAL CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
THE CIRCUIT RUNS
THEY CIRCULATE WITH AN INSULATOR INSULATES ELECTRICITY THEREFORE THE INSULATOR THE CIRCUIT WILL NOT RUN
CLOSED
I MAKE A CLOSED CIRCUITS
ALL OF THE METALS IN THE LIST ARE CONDUCT ARE DO CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
WE’VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND OTHER THING
A CIRCUIT IS CURRENTLY RUNNING
INSULATORS ARE NOT MADE OF METALS THEREFORE THE CIRCUIT WILL NOT RUN
ALL METALS CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
THE-
NO
<NO_SIGNAL>
THERE IS A STEEL NAIL CONNECTING THE SWITCH
WHEN ADD AN INSULATOR TO A CIRCUIT THE CIRCUIT IS NOT RUNNING
<NO_SIGNAL>
ALL METALS CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
IT IS NOT RUNNING
THE CIRCUIT IS OPEN
<NO_SIGNAL>
THE MOTOR DOESN’T RUN
GOOD
GOOD
SINCE MAGNETS SPACERS A LOT WASHERS LITTLE
MORE WASHERS COMING TO THE RIGHT SIDE
WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
REPRESENTS DISTANCE
SLIT MAGNETS
IT MAKES THE WASHER- IT MAKES IT <INDISCERNIBLE> LESS WASHERS

LET’S STILL APPLY (*)
WHITE MAGNETS
YEAH SPACERS SO WHEN YOU IN SPACERS- SPACERS MAGNETIC FORCE LESS
TWO TWO TWO TWO TWO
SERIES CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
THE ENERGY HAS TO GO THROUGH MANY MORE WIRES
THE SERIES CIRCUIT IT DOESN'T BRIGHT AS BRIGHTLY AS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
I ALREADY HAD- ENERGY GOES INTO ONE LIGHTBULB COMES OUT AND GOES TO ANOTHER LIGHTBULB AND THEN GOES AGAIN TO THE SECOND LIGHTBULB AND LIGHT IT AND +BLAH+
TOP ONES ARE MUCH BRIGHTER
WE HAVE BEEN DOING NOTHING
IT GLOWS GREEN
<NO_SIGNAL>
PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THE BLUE DOTS ARE ENERGY AND THAT THE ENERGY IS COMING INTO THE ENERGY IS COMING- THE ENERGY IS COMING FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D-CELL THEN SHOOTING OUT OF THE END IN THE NEGATIVE SIDE COMES UP TO THE FIRST ONE COMES OUT- COMES OUT TO THE SECOND ONE COMES DOWN FROM THE BULB CASING COMES IN AND THEN GO BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
<NO_SIGNAL>
ELECTRICITY RUNS FROM ONE END AND ANOTHER
THE TWO BATTERIES DON’T MAKE JUST MAKE THEM JUST MAKE THEM JUST MAKE THEM LAST LONGER AND LAST NOT POWER WELL MORE POWERFUL
THE D CELL IS LIGHTING THE BATTERY THE WIRES ARE ATTRACTING THE ENERGY AND THUS A LIGHTBULB ARE SHOWING THE ENERGY TRANSFER
THEY ALL HAVE TWO BATTERIES YEAH
THAT’S EVEN MORE BRIGHTER
IT’S THAT LIGHT THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT LIGHTS THE BULBS MORE BRIGHTLY THAN THE SERIES CIRCUIT THEY’RE +TRPTRP+
THAT
OF COURSE THERE’S TWO BATTERIES
A PARALLEL IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
CAN YOU REPEAT
I NEED HELP
<NO_SIGNAL>
THE ENERGY HAS TO GOES THROUGH MANY MANY MORE WIRES THEREFORE THE ENERGY WILL LOSE
THE LIGHT BULB TAKES IN ENERGY AND TAKES OUT ENERGY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
LIKE MAYBE WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A HOUSE IN IN SQUARE FEET AND Y YOU GUESS IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FIFTY SIX SQUARE FEET BUT YOU FIFTY SIX SQUARE FEET BUT THEN THEY HAD TO CUT OUT A PART SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE AWAY LET'S SAY SIXTEEN FEET THEN YOU MIGHT ESTIMATE THAT TO SEE WHAT IDEA OF HOW MANY SQUARE FEET THERE WILL BE AND SEE IF YOU'RE CORRECT
YEAH
WELL WE LOOKED AT IT AND BY CENTIMETERS AND METERS AND WE JUST SORTA GUESSED
UH YEAH
NO YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
NO
AND WE KNEW IT WAS OVER A METER CAUSE THE DOORKNOB IS ABOUT A METER SO THAT'S HOW WE FIGURED OUT UM IF IT'S MORE THAN A METER OR LESS THAN A METER AND THEN WE JUST SORTA GUESSED
WELL IN MY BRAIN I WAS JUST SORTA THINKING OF HOW LONG TEN CENTIMETERS WERE AND JUST SORTA GUESSING AND ADDING MORE ON TO FIGURE OUT HOW BIG THEY WERE
LIKE FROM LIKE OUR WHITE BOARD OUR WIDTH OF OUR WHITE BOARD UM YEAH AND LIKE K TWO DESK TWO DESK WIDTHS TWO LENGTHS OF DESK AND THEN YOU JUST SORTA GO AROUND AND FIND STUFF THAT YOU WANT TO MEASURE
WELL CENTIMETERS AND METERS BOTH BELONG TO THE GROUP OF THE METRIC SYSTEM
TWENTY EACH EACH ROW HAD TWENTY
WELL BECAUSE UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT THEY I THINK THEY JUST WANT US TO BE GOOD ESTIMATORS
WELL THEY JUST WANTED US TO MAKE THEM I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA MEASURE WITH THEM AND CAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH METER STICKS IN THE CLASS OR METER TAPES IN THE CLASS FOR EVERYBODY WE'D HAVE TO SHARE SO I GUESS WE JUST MADE THOSE TO MEASURE
WELL WELL SO THERE WAS TWO THERE WAS FIVE ROWS AND ONE SECTION OF THE ROW HAD TEN AND THE OTHER SECTION HAD TEN AND YOU COLORED EACH TEN IN FROM THE FIVE ROWS AND THEN YOU UH CUT IT OUT INTO FIVE STRIPS AND THERE WAS THIS EXTRA SPACE YOU CUT OUT ALL THIS BUT THERE WAS AN EXTRA SPACE HERE AND THEN LIKE ON THE RIGHT THERE WAS AN EXTRA SPACE AND THEN YOU TAKE THE NEXT STRIP AND TAPE IT ON CAUSE IT HAS A ZERO LIKE THE FIRST STRIP ENDED WITH A THREE BUT THEN THE NEXT STRIP STARTED WITH A ZERO AND YOU PUT THE ZERO RIGHT BY THE THREE TO COMPLETE THE CIRCLE AND IT KEEPS GOING ON AND ON AND THEN YOU JUST GE- AND THEN YOU TAPE THEM AND THEN YOU HAVE A METER TAPE
YEAH
YEAH OR HE WAS THINKING OF THE TABLE WHAT'S A LENGTHWISE IT COULDN'T GET THROUGH
WELL LIKE SOMETIMES YOU GUESS BUT SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE WAY OFF AND SOMETIMES YOU JUST GUESS AND DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT IT THAT MUCH AND IT'S LIKE RIGHT
WELL WHEN YOU ESTIMATE SORTA LIKE WHEN YOU'RE DOING A MATH PROBLEM SOMETIMES YOU ESTIMATE IT BEFORE LIKE ROUNDING IT AND ESTIMATING IT BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY DO IT SO YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT IT WILL EQUAL
WELL YOU JUST SORTA LOOK AT SOMETHING AND YOU DECIDE AND YOU TRY TO THINK YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO MEASURE AND THEN YOU TRY TO THINK AND THEN TRY TO ESTIMATE IT AND THEN ONCE YOU DO LIKE SIX YOU GO BACK MEASURE IT AND TELL THE DIFFERENCE SO
YEAH
WHAT WAS UP WITH WHAT
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
OUR MEASURING TAPES WE MADE OUR METER TAPES
YOU GO BACK AND WHAT YEAH CAUSE SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S RIGHT
UM WELL TODAY UH WE UM GUESSED WE ESTIMATED HOW BIG THE LENGTH OF SOMETHING AND THEN WE WROTE IT DOWN AND THEN WE MADE THESE METER TAPES YET YESTERDAY AND WE USED THOSE TO SEE HOW BY WE WERE AND THEN WE UM AND THEN WE SHOWED THE DIFFERENCE IN BETWEEN AND
WELL THE FIRST ONE I WAS RIGHT ON AND THEN IT GOT WORSE AND THEN IT GOT BETTER AND THEN IT GOT WORSE AND THEN IT GOT BETTER
YEAH
I THINK THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE EXCEPT MAYBE SOMETHING'S BLOCKING THE WAY A LITTLE AND IT'S CUTTING A LITTLE OFF IT
YEAH IT TAUGHT US ABOUT HOW BIG A DECIMETER IS HOW BIG A CENTIMETER IS AND A METER IS
YEAH
YEAH
I'M NOT REALLY SURE EXCEPT SOMETIMES WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT I DON'T GET IT
A
THE FLIPPER STICK HAS UM
S RIGHT IT MAKES TWO GRAPHS SO IT'S TWO GRAPHS SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE'S RIGHT IN ONE GRAPH YOU NEED TWO SEPARATE GRAPHS UM DO ONE FIRST THEN ANOTHER ONE SECOND
BYE
THE YELLOW LINE SHOWS LARGE FOIL BALL THAT IT MIGHT GO SLOWER BECAUSE IT'S LARGER AND IT'S BIGGER AND HEAVIER
BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE A LOT OF THING IT'LL THE EXPERIMENT MIGHT BE WRONG AND YOU'RE NOT SURE IF IT'S RIGHT OR NOT
GOOD
YES
THANKS
YES THAT'S CORRECT
MOLLY'S MY PARTNER SO SHE SHE DID ALL THE WORK BECAUSE I WAS SICK ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY SO I DIDN'T UM TEST THEM SO I JUST COPIED DOWN ON HER PAPER BUT SHE TOLD ME UM IT IT WORKED AND IT WAS GOOD
I THINK THE <BREATH> I THINK THE LONGER ONE BECAUSE IT'S FARTHER AND UM AND THE SHORT ONE GOES SHORTER SO IT'S NOT THAT MUCH SPACE BUT THE LONGER ONE HAS MUCH SPACE IN THEM
THE PICTURE'S TELLING HOW FAR THE CORK'S FLYING WITH THE FLIPPER STICK SO IT'S IT FLEW FORTY CENTIMETERS
S
YOU COULD CHANGE A LOT OF THINGS WITH THE EXPERIMENT IT MATTERS
ONE THING AT A TIME
THE UM CATAPULT AND THE FLIPPER STICK ONE PICTURE SHOWS IT'S ONE CENTIMETER THE OTHER ONE SHOWS IT'S FIVE CENTIMETERS
IT SHOWS HOW MANY CENTIMETERS SO I AND IT GOES UP TO FIVE CENTIMETERS
IT'S GETTING HIGHER AND HIGHER
IT'S A GRAPH
YESTERDAY WE MADE THIS GRAPH TO FINISH UM THE THE UM HOW FAR THE CORK FLEW
IT'S COUNTING BY TENS AND IT'S MOVING UP BY CENTIMETERS
THE VARIABLE YOU COULD TEST WAS THE ANGLE SO IT'S GOING BACKWARDS FORTY CENTIMETERS
YES IT DOES
IT EFFECTS THE RESULTS BECAUSE YOU YOU'RE
<BREATH> THEY DECREASE
I'M FINE
OR A RULER
WE MADE DIFFERENT SIZED PENDULUMS AND THEN YESTERDAY WE LET THEM GO AT THE SAME HEIGHT AND COUNTED ALL THE SWINGS
THEY CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND THEY ALSO CHANGED WHEN YOU CHANGED HOW HIGH YOU HOLD THE STRING
UM I THINK UH <BREATH> UM THE UM SO BASICALLY THE DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF THE STRING CHANGES WHAT THE HOW FAST OR HOW SLOW IT GOES I DON'T THINK THE WEIGHT CHANGES IT I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU ASKED
WE TAPED A PENCIL TO EITHER A DESK OR A SHELF AND THEN WE PUT THE LOOP O ON THE STRING ON TO IT HELD THE PENNY TO THE LENGTH OF THE SHELF OR THE DESK AND THEN LET GO AND COUNTED HOW MANY SWINGS IT MADE
SO YOU CAN TELL HOW IT CHANGED AS YOU CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME
WE FOUND OUT UM
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
WE FOUND OUT THAT THE LONGER THE STRING IS THE SLOWER IT GOES THE SHORTER IT IS THE THE FASTER IT GOES SO SHORTER MORE SWINGS LONGER MORE SWINGS I MEAN LESS SWINGS
THAT YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME TO THE SAME THING SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT
I HAVE
WE KEPT THE PENNY AND THE PAPERCLIP THE SAME AND THE LOOP THE SAME
WE UM MEASURE IT ON UM <BREATH>
O ON MEASURING TAPE
WE SAW HOW FAST THEY COULD GO
I THINK THAT'S ALL WE DID AND WE TRY OH YEAH AND WE TRIED DIFFERENT HEIGHTS TO LET IT GO AND TRIED HOW HARD WE PUSHED IT
YOU'RE WELCOME
WE TAPED THEM TO OUR DESK AND THEN HELD THEM UP AND WE ALL DID THE SAME THING AND THEN WE JUST DROPPED THEM
AND IT'S EASIER TO TELL WHAT'S HAPPENING
SO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED IT AND HOW IT CHANGED
WE HELD THEM TO THE EXACT LENGTH OF THE TOP OF THE DESK AND THEN JUST LET GO OF 'EM AND COUNTED HOW MANY TIMES THEY WENT BACK AND FORTH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT PENDULUMS ARE
I'M OKAY
YEAH
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW YOU ADD THINGS UM TO CHANGE WHAT HAPPENS TO OTHER THINGS
WE SOMETIMES ADDED MORE STRING
THAT WAY WE CAN SEE HOW THINGS CHANGED AND WHAT CHANGES THAT
-TUR CH-
OKAY
UM I THINK SO THEN YOU
HI
FIRST WE MEASURED IT THEN WE S DREW A CROSS
BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZES
IT CAN AFFECT IT BY THE DIFFERENT SIZE THE PLACEMENT OR THE UM WAY THE WATER MOVES
WE'VE BEEN BUILDING BOATS AND SEEING HOW MUCH PENNIES CAN FIT IN THE BOAT DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OR THE UH THE SIZE
IT UM I THINK WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS THAT YOU CAN JUST CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME SO EVERYTHING HAS TO BE CONTROLLED BY YOU
WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE CALMNESS OF THE WATER IS THAT IT AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY WELL THE WAVES SHOULDN'T TIP THE WAVES OVER TOO MUCH SO THEN YOU WOULDN'T CAUSE THEN YOU WOULDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH UM THEN IT COULD TIP THE BOAT OVER AND THEN YOU WOULDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH UM PENNIES WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN IT IF IT'S CALM IT'S A LOT EASIER TO TELL
WE MEASURED THE BOATS AND MAKE THEM DIFFERENT SIZES AND THEN WE PUT WATER IN THEM AND SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD THEN WE SEE THEN WE LET IT FLOAT IN WATER AND SEE HOW MANY PENNIES WE CAN PUT IN TIL IT SINKS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT CAN EFFECT IT BY THE SIZE OR
IT GOES IT GETS SMALLER AS IT GOES A B C D AND IF IT'S SMALL IT CAN'T HOLD AS MANY CAUSE THE IT WILL SINK AS IT GETS MORE FOR ALL BOATS IT SINKS AS IT GETS MORE AND B WOULD PROBABLY CAR A WOULD CARRY ABOUT PROBABLY MAYBE PROBABLY TO TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE B WOULD PROBABLY CARRY ABOUT SIXTEEN TO S UM EIGHTEEN AND C WOULD PROBABLY CARRY ABOUT TWELVE TO FOURTEEN D WOULD PROBABLY CARRY ABOUT FIVE TO MAYBE NINE OR TEN
THANK YOU
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU HAVE TO ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME SO YOU COULD MAKE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE WE MADE DIFFERENT CUPS WE DIDN'T JUST KEEP START WITH A BIG SIZE AND KEEP CUTTING IT LOWER AND LOWER WE MADE DIFFERENT ONES TO CHECK THE SIZE AND PUT AND THEN WE JUST TOOK 'EM OVER CHECKED HOW MUCH WATER COULD FIT IN IT AND HOW MUCH PENNIES TIL IT SUNK
YES IT
SO THEN YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED AND HOW IT CHANGE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARNIE
OKAY BYE MARNIE
THEY FLOAT IN THE OCEAN AND THEY CARRY PEOPLE PASSENGERS AND SOMETIMES EMERGENCY LUGGAGE
WELL WE PUT DIFFERENT SIZES BUT I THINK UM IT'S STRANGE THAT IF THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE THAT THEY HOLD DIFFERENT PA S UM AMOUNTS OF PENNIES THAT'S VERY STRANGE BUT UM IF THEY'RE ALL THREE CENTIMETERS THAT'S INTERESTING FOR ME AND IT BUT IF THEY'RE THREE CENTIMETERS LONG THEN THAT'S DIFFERENT BUT IF THEY'RE ALL T THREE CENTIMETERS TALL THAT'S STRANGE
<BREATH> IT WAS IMPORTANT SO WE COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE OF HOW MANY PENNIES IT COULD HOLD
WE BUILT THEM OUT OF PAPER CUT CUPS
WELL AS YOU CAN TELL FOR THE ONE THAT HAS FIFTEEN IN IT ON THE RIGHT SIDE ALL OF THE PENNIES ARE TO THE SIDE STA ON TO THE RIGHT SIDE STACKED UP THAT MEANS THE THAT THE CUP WILL TIP AND IF YOU PUT TOO MUCH ON IT WILL JUST FLIP OVER AND THAT'S NOT GOOD ON THE LEFT SIDE THERE'RE TWENTY IN IT AND JUST STACKED UP PERFECTLY IT'S STAYING BETTER UP BUT IT WILL STAY UP FOR LONGER BUT NOT TOO LONG
IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN'T JUST DROP IT STRAIGHT DOWN EVEN IF THEY'RE PLACED IN DIFFERENT PLACES SO IT WON'T FALL IT WILL STILL JUST SINK CAUSE OF HOW MUCH YOU PUSH IT DOWN PUSH IT DOWN AND FOR HOW STRAIGHT IT IS EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY SET IT DOWN PERFECTLY IT'S NOT SPREAD OUT SO IT MAY JUST NEED TO GO STRAIGHT DOWN IF IT'S
<BREATH> THEY ARE DESIGNED TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIFES IN IN CASE A BOAT STARTS TO SINK OR GETS OR SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS TO IT IT CAN HOLD PEOPLE AND THEY CAN SAIL AND THEY CAN TAKE IT BACK AND THEY CAN SAIL BACK TO A SAFE PLACE OR A DIFFERENT
WE FIGURED OUT THAT UM DIFFERENT SIZES CAN WELL BIGGER SIZES CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES SMALLER SIZES CAN HOLD LESS
<BREATH> IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT HOW ON THE RIGHT SIDE IT'S THEY'RE SPREAD OUT SO IT DOESN'T SINK AS FAST AND ON THE LEFT SIDE THEY'RE ALL JUST STRAIGHT DOWN AND YOU PROBABLY JUST AND IT'S SUNK IT'S DOWN MORE INTO THE WATER ON THE LEFT SIDE AND IT'S HIGHER UP ON THE RIGHT BUT IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THERE ARE UM MORE ON THE LEFT AND LESS ON THE RIGHT
WELL I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF PENNIES IN THEM CAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY DIFFERENT PLACEMENTS
THANK YOU
WE GENTLY SET THEM INTO THE BOAT AND WE TRIED TO MAKE THEM AS EVEN AS POSSIBLE SO WE COULD TELL SO THEY WOULDN'T BE JUST STRAIGHT DOWN SO IT WOULDN'T TILT TO THE SIDE AND JUST SINK MUCH EASIER
IF YOU PUT 'EM IN TOO HARD OR UM YOU COULD PUSH SOME WATER IN IT THEN IT WOULD CHANGE HOW MUCH IT COULD HOLD OR YOU AND IF YOU PUT IT T TOO MUCH TO THE SIDE THEN IT COULD JUST FLIP OVER
I FIGURED UM I DON'T KNOW VARI VARIABLES ARE
THANK YOU MARNIE
IT CAN ALSO TELL HOW BIG SOMETHING GETS AND FOR EXAMPLE LIKE HOW THINGS GO FROM SMALLEST TO BIGGEST OR HOW MUCH THINGS WEIGH OR THINGS LIKE THAT
HOW MANY WHAT VERTICAL LINE
HOW VARIABLES CHANGE THINGS
WHAT <LAUGH>
UM THAT
<BREATH> I'M FINE <BREATH> HOW ARE YOU
SEE YOU LATER ON
SO THE X AXIS THE Y AXIS AND THE AND THE Y AXIS IS HOW MANY PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD AND THE X AXIS IS THE CAPA- THE AMOUNT OF CAPACITY THE BOAT IS
YEAH
WE DID BY US DOING EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY MAKING THEIR BOATS PRETTY MUCH ALL EXACTLY THE SAME
REALLY
WHEN YOU MAKE WAVES THE BOAT TIPS OVER I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING AND WHEN YOU STACK THE PENNIES WRONG THEY FLIP OVER YOU HAVE TO STACK THEM EVENLY
WE CHANGED HOW BIG THE BOATS WERE
WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING
YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH THINGS WEIGH HOW TALL THEY ARE OR THINGS FROM BIGGEST TO SMALLEST
THE Y AXIS IS THE UM THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS THE BOAT CAN HOLD
OH UM WELL IF THERE'RE NO WAVES IT'S FINE IT'S MUCH EASIER IF THERE ARE ANY WAVES IT COULD SHAKE THE BOAT AND IT COULD FLIP OVER ALSO IF YOU STACK ALL THE PENNIES ON ONE SIDE IT WILL FLIP OVER BUT IF YOU STACK THEM EVENLY THEN IT WILL JUST STAY PERFECTLY STRAIGHT
WHICH WORDS
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
WE DID
YOU'RE WELCOME BYE MARNIE
IT'S ABOUT HOW
TO SEE HOW MUCH SOMETHING IS OR HOW MUCH
I FOUND OUT THAT YOU CAN
THAT IT DEPENDS ON THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT AS THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT GETS BIGGER THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS GETS BIGGER
WHAT
OKAY
HOW MUCH WATER WELL HOW MUCH UM WAIT
WELL BYE MARNIE HAVE A NICE DAY
WE CHANGED THE PLANES TO UM HOW WE CHANGED NO WE DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING
THAT'S OKAY
AS THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT GETS SMALLER THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS GETS SMALLER TOO SO PRETTY MUCH IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CAPACITY
HI MARNIE
IF THERE ARE ANY WAVES OR HOW MUCH OR HOW YOU STACKED THE PENNY UM THE PASSENGER WHICH IS THE PENNY OR UM YEAH THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
I DISCOVERED THAT EVERY TIME YOU CHANGE THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS EITHER GOES DOWN OR UP JUST LIKE THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT
<BREATH> WE DISCOVERED THAT EVERY TIME YOU ADD TWO MORE PAPER CLIPS TO THE PLANE IT GOES A SHORTER DISTANCE
OKAY BYE MARNIE
THANK YOU
THE N NUMBER OF MOTORS THAT ARE THE RUBBER BANDS
THANK YOU
WHAT
YOU THINK ABOUT HOW HOW MUCH THE DISTANCE CHANGES WHEN YOU ADD MORE PASSENGERS AND HOW IT KIND OF MAKES THE LINE AND KIND OF CONNECTS WHEN YOU PUT IT ON A DATA CHART
YEAH
IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT OPPOSITE FROM THE OTHER CHART CAUSE THE NUMBER OF MOTORS AS YOU ADD AS YOU ADD MORE IT GETS HIGHER AND THE DI THE DISTANCE OF THE PLANE GETS HIGHER AS YOU ADD MORE RUBBER BANDS <COUGH> AND UM THE PASSENGERS WHEN YOU ADD MORE PASSENGERS THE DISTANCE OF THE PLANE GETS LOWER SO THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT DIFFERENT
CAUSE YOU KEEP
WELL ON THE Y AXIS IS HOW FAR THE PLANE WENT SO THE DISTANCE OF THE PLANE AND THE X AXIS IS HOW MANY PASSENGERS WERE ON THE PLANE WELL THAT'S HOW I GRAPHED IT AT LEAST
PROBABLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY OR AROUND THAT
MORE WITH MORE PAS AS YOU ADD MORE PASSENGERS THE L LINE GETS LOWER LOWER AND LOWER
I NOTICE ONCE AGAIN THAT WELL I NOTICE THAT <BREATH> WITH THE SAME NUMBERS OF WINDS WHICH IS THIRTY FIVE AND CHANGING THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS THE DISTANCE WILL MOST LIKELY CHANGE EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE WINDING AT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME
I'M PRETTY GOOD
THAT'S WHAT I DID IN MY TEST
I MEAN TO TWO HUNDRED F HE NO ACTUALLY PROBABLY AROUND ONE HUNDRED NINETY OR EIGHTY PROBABLY
WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLANES AND TESTING HOW FAR THEY CAN GO WITH PAPER CLIPS ON THEM
THE LINE STARTS AT SIX HU PRETTY MUCH AROUND SIX HUNDRED AND THEN JUST GOES LOWER AND LOWER AND LOWER SO PRETTY MUCH DIAGNOL
YOU KEEP ADDING ONE MORE PASSENGER AS YOU GO
I NOTICED THAT WITH ONCE AGAIN WITH
YOU CAN SEE IS YOU ADD MORE PASSENGERS THE THE DISTANCE IN CENTIMETERS GETS THAT THE PLANE FLIES GETS LOWER LOWER AND LOWER MUCH MUCH A LOT LOWER
AROUND ONE HUNDRED
I LEARNED THAT EVERY TIME YOU ADD MORE PASSENGER AS THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS GETS HIGHER THE DISTANCE OF THE PLANE GETS LOWER WELL GETS SHORTER
THE DISTANCE GOES HIGHER
IT'S OKAY
YOU'RE WELCOME
IT WOULD NOT ACT AS A MAGNET IT'D ACT LIKE A NORMAL PIECE OF METAL INSTEAD OF A MAGNET
BECAUSE OF MORE OF THE IT'S FLOWING MORE OF IT'S FLOWING <BREATH> THROUGH AND IT'S BUILDING MAKING IT A STRONGER MAGNET TO GO BACK INTO THE INTO THE <BREATH> BAT BATTERY AND GO AROUND AGAIN BUT IT HAS MORE TO PICK UP MORE
<BREATH> WE UM HAD THE BATTERY AND ON THE MINUS SIGN WE HAD IT <BREATH> WELL WE HAD IT CONNECTING THE SWITCH AND A BATTERY A LITTLE BATTERY <BREATH> WITH ONE WIRE AND WE HAD A REALLY LONG WIRE <BREATH> THAT CONNECTED FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY WHICH WE WRAPPED AROUND THIS UM THIS METAL THING <LAUGH> AND THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER SIDE AND TO PUT IT TO THE SWITCH SO THAT WE COULD WITH OUR LITTLE IRONS TRY TO PICK THEM UP AND SEE HOW MANY WE GOT AND WE COULD TURN IT IT OFF SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GRAB THEM OFF INSTEAD
MORE WASHERS WOULD COME UP WITH IT
THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH <BREATH>
THE SWITCH MAKES IT SO WHEN WE CONNECT THE WIRES THAT IT ALLOWS US TO TURN IT ON AND OFF THE D CELL <BREATH> IS IN VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THE WHOLE ELECTRICITY FLOW WOULDN'T WORK AND <BREATH> THE METAL THING <BREATH> IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE SOMETHING TO USE AS A MAGNET WE WOULDN'T USE WE'LL NEED SOMETHING FOR THE MAGNET AND THE WIRE WE NEED <BREATH> BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THAT CONNECTS AND HAS THAT CONNECTS IT TO TO EVERYTHING IN THE IRONS WE USED TO PICK THEY WE USED AS THE PICKING SOMETHI- A SOURCE OF SOMETHING TO PICK
GOOD
THE SWITCH IS THERE SO THAT WE CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF WHICH HELPS US SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GRAB THEM OFF THE MAGNET WE HAVE A LOT OF SWITCHES AROUND OUR HOU IN OUR HOUSES AND THE SWITCH IS THERE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PICK THEM UP AND TURN IT OFF <BREATH> WITHOUT <BREATH> SO WE DON'T <BREATH> TO TO PUT THEM UP AND DOWN WITHOUT HAVING TO GRAB THEM OFF INSTEAD
IT IS COMING OUT OF THE MINUS SIGN ON THE D CELL GOING THROUGH WHAT TO THE SWIT- SWITCH <BREATH> THEN FLOWING TO THE OTHER SIDE <BREATH> AND IT GOES WHERE TO THE ELECTROMAGNET IS AND IT'S BEEN WRAPPED AROUND TO MANY EVER MANY TIMES THAT THERE IT IS AT THAT POINT <BREATH> AND THEN IT GOES BACK DOWN INTO THE PLUS OUT THE MINUS AND ALL OVER AGAIN
THERE IS ONLY TEN WRAPS AROUND INSTEAD TEN WRAPPED AROUND INSTEAD OF MORE AND IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME THING BUT IT'S ONLY PICKING UP THREE INSTEAD OF A LOT MORE
WE MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET
WE HAD HAD TO WRAP IT AROUND WE WRAPPED IT AROUND MORE TIMES AS WE WENT UP BECAUSE WE WERE CHARTING IT DOWN AND WE WRAPPED IT UP MORE AND MORE WE STARTED AT TEN WENT TO TWENTY <BREATH> THEN TO THIRTY THEN WE WENT TO FORTY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH WIRE FOR FIFTY
YES
IT IS THE ELEC- TRICITY IS THE THING THAT COULD THE STUFF THAT GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE THING TO MAKE IT WORK
YES WELL IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING IF IT WASN'T WORKING SO I THINK IT IS GREAT
WELL WE WRAPPED THE WIRE AROUND AND THE MORE TIMES THAT WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE STRONGER THE MAG IT TURNED INTO AS A MAGNET SO UM WE THE MORE TIMES WE WRAPPED IT AROUND THE MORE MAGNETS WE COULD PICK UP THE IRONS
IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND LESS IT WILL PICK UP THE MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE MORE WASHERS IT WILL PICK UP IF YOU WRAP IT AROUND LESS THEN THE LITTLER IT WILL PICK UP
IF WE DID THAT THE WIRE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT <BREATH> THE MAGNET WAS THERE SO IT WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY
YES
<BREATH> IF THE MAGNET WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY THEY WOULDN'T PICK UP ANY YOU'D KNOW THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WORKING <BREATH>
<BREATH> MORE <BREATH> WASHERS ARE COMING UP TO IT COMING UP <BREATH> BECAUSE IT'S GETTING STONGER
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING MAGNETISM
THEY'RE *ATTRACTING* EACH OTHER SO THEY CAN COME TOGETHER
AND THE ROCK THE S STEEL ROCK
THE MAGNETS ON THE NAIL THAT CAN MAKE IT A STRONGER TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP IT'S A LOT STRONGER WITH THE MAGNET ON IT
WELL IT CAN DO IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT IT UH IT CAN'T DO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME
IT DOES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE IT CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU MAYBE DO IT AGAIN
WE HAVE <BREATH> PUT THEM IN BOXES AND THEN TOOK S STEEL SHAVINGS AND A COMPASS TO TRY TO FIND EM <BREATH> <FP> THAT OTHER PEOPLE MADE CAUSE THE MAGNETS WERE STICKED STUCK TAPED ONTO THE BOX SO YOU HAD TO TRY TO FIND IT
THEY CAME TOGETHER BECAUSE THE <BREATH> WHAT THEY'RE MADE OUT OF F WOULD C WOULD MAKE THEM COME TOGETHER SO THAT THEY COULD SOMETIMES GO THROUGH STUFF
IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE IF IF YOU TOUCHED IT AND BROUGHT IT UP
WHEN THEY STUCK TOGETHER THEY WOULD STAY LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND BUT IF THEY DIDN'T STICK THEY WOULD
WE TOOK SOME STEEL <BREATH> UM NAILS AND <FP> A LOT OF OTHER STUFF TO SEE WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT *ATTRACT* AND WHAT WOULDN'T
WHEREVER YOU PUT THE MAGNET THEY WILL IF THEY HAVE THE OPPOSITE SIDES THEY WILL COME TOGETHER AND YOU CAN MAKE EM STAY LIKE THA-
YEAH SOME OF THEM STICKED WITH SOME SOME OF THE IRON FILINGS STICKED BUT SOME DIDN'T
YEAH SOMETIMES
WE FOUND OUT THE PAPER CLIP AND <BREATH> THE N NET THE NAIL DID
THEY ATTRACTED EACH OTHER
-TTRACTED EACH OTHER
IT IT STUCK ON ONTO THEM A LOT MORE WHEN THEY LOOKED NEWER THE OLDER ONES DIDN'T STICK T AS WELL
THE NAILS AND THE PAPER CLIP
THEY DON'T STICK AS WELL TO OTHER STUFF AND ALSO THE OLD SHAVING THINGS ALSO DIDN'T STICK <BREATH> IF THEY WERE ALL UNDONE
THEY WILL STICK BECAUSE SINCE THE MAGNETS RUBBED ON TH THE STEEL THE NAIL THEN THAT MAKES IT SO THAT SINCE THEY RUBBED TOGETHER THAT MAKES IT SO SOME OF THE MAGNE- <FP> IT MAKES IT M A BIT MAGNETIZED SO WE CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
YES <BREATH>
IT WOULD POINT TO THE MAGNETS *SO* FIND AND YOU COULD START GOING CLOSER AND IT'LL POINT A DIFFERENT WAY AFTER YOU GET THERE TOWARDS THE OTHER MAGNET THERE WAS TWO MAGNETS THAT YOU TAPED IN
YEAH IT COMES TOGETHER
O THAT THE NAIL JUST KINDA DOES WHAT THE MAGNET CAN DO
YES BECAUSE CARDBOARD THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN GO THROUGH THIN CARDBOARD BUT THICK CARDBOARD IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THEY'LL DEPENDING UPON HOW STRONG THE MAGNET IS
YOU HAD TO TAKE EITHER THE COMPASS <BREATH> A PAPER CLIP OR THE STEEL SHAVINGS AND TRY USE THEM TO TRY TO FIND IT THE COMPASS WOULD POINT NORTH TOWARDS IT SO YOU COULD FIND IT <BREATH> THE PAPER CLIP YOU COULD FEEL IT GET HEAVIER <BREATH> AND WITH THE SHAVINGS WHEN YOU FOUND IT THEY WOULD COME UP
IT DIDN'T ALWAYS STICK ALL THE TIME BUT SOMETIMES IT DID
SINCE THEY *ATTRACT* THEY COME THROUGH AND THEY CAN SOMETIMES <BREATH> DEPENDING UPON HOW THICK IT IS GO THROUGH TABLES AND OTHER THINGS
NOT AS LONG AS LIKE SOMETHING YOU CAN'T STAY LIKE THAT AS LONG AS A MAGNET
A LOT OF TIMES IT'S STEEL OR METAL STUFF
THEY ATTRACT EACH OTHER <FP> EVEN THOUGH IT'S THROUGH THE THIN CARDBOARD IT WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WAS THICK
WE <BREATH> MADE THEM <BREATH> WE FOUND OUT WHAT WOULD COME TOGETHER WITH IT AND WHAT WOULDN'T
THE PAPER CLIP <BREATH> YOU COULD FIND IT AND IT WOULD FEEL HEAVIER AND M <BREATH> ON IT BECAUSE YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THE MAGNET WOULD BE REALLY BY LIKE YOU MIGHT BE ON THE SIDE OF IT AND YOU'LL KNOW
MAGNET DID
GOOD
THEY CAN ATTRACT THROUGH THINGS THAT ARE TH THIN BUT NOT IF NOT LIKE THICK CARDBOARD SO <BREATH> THEY COULDN'T G ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING BUT THEY COULD ATTRACT THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S THIN LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THE OTHER MAGNET BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE FIRST MAGNET
WE HAVE BEEN DOING UM ELECTRICITY
GOOD
BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT BULB IS ON <BREATH>
WE TOOK A BATTERY AND A WIRE AND CONNECTED IT TO THIS LITTLE CLIP WITH ANOTHER ONE THAT <BREATH> ANOTHER CLIP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY THAT CONNECTED TO A SWITCH <BREATH> AND THE SWITCH <BREATH> ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THE CLIP HAD A WIRE THAT CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT <BREATH> WHICH WOULD HELP IT
WE TOOK ONE OF THE WIRES ON THE MOTOR AND CONNECTED IT TO THIS LITTLE CLIP NEXT TO THE BATTERY THAT KEPT IT BY THE BATTERY <BREATH> AND THEN WITH THE OTHER ONE WE PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT'S THE ONE WITHOUT THE SWITCH AND THEN WHEN WE DID IT WITH THE SWITCH WE TOOK IT AND <BREATH> WE GOT THIS PIECE OF WIREISH THING AND <FP> WE CONNECTED ONE END <FP> OF THE MOTOR'S WIRES TO IT TO THE CLIP AND THEN WE TOOK THE OTHER ONE AND CONNECTED IT TO A CLIP BY THE SWITCH AND THEN WITH THE WIRE WE CLIPPED IT ON THE OTHER CLIP BY THE SWITCH AND CONNECTED THAT ONE TO THE OTHER <BREATH>
THE UM <BREATH> THE WHAT WAS IT CALLED THE UM <BREATH>
BY THE BATTERY
THE MOTOR <BREATH> IS GOING FROM ALL OF IT <BREATH> THE UM <BREATH> THE <BREATH> BATTERY HAS THE TWO THE OF THEM THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR WHICH HAS THEM ALL CONNECTED AND SINCE THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED IT MAKES THE MOTOR GO <BREATH>
THAT IS THE SWITCH TURNING THE MOTOR ON BY IT'S GOING BY THAT THAT'S HITTING IT TO MAKE THE WIRE KNOW THAT'S THERE AND THEN IT GOES TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THAT GOES TO THE MOTOR
WELL UM THE <BREATH> BATTERY
THEY HAVE TO TOUCH IT OR ELSE THEY WON'T KNOW THAT IT'S THERE <BREATH> IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY TOUCHING IT BUT IT HAS TO BE PRETTY NEAR OF IT NEAR IT REALLY BY <BREATH> DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACTLY BUT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING IT LITTLE BIT
THE BATTERY IS <FP> GIVING THE WI- GIVING SOME <BREATH> TO <BREATH> TO MAKE THE SWITCH TURN IT ON THE BATTERY'S PUTTING THE S <FP> UH IS PUTTING THE ELECTRICITY INTO THE WIRES WHICH THAT A THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE <BREATH> MOTOR AND THE SWITCH HAS IS THERE BECAUSE THE WIRE IS THERE AND THE SWITCH WHEN IT <BREATH> GOES OVER THERE IT HITS THAT IT MAKES THE <BREATH> BATTERY KNOW <BREATH> <FP> AND THEN IT TELLS THE MOTOR TO GO ON
LITTLE THINGS I FORGOT THE NAME OF THEM GO THROUGH THE WIRE IN THROUGH THEM LIKE DON'T GO THROUGH THEM BUT KINDA GO AGAINST AND KINDA GO THROUGH IT FEELS KINDA LIKE <BREATH>
WHEN THE MOTOR STARTS TO GO
<BREATH> THE BATTERY UM <BREATH> TELLS THEM THE <BREATH> THE M
<BREATH> IS HELPING IT BUT IT'S NOT THE FULL THING
THE BATTERY PUSHES IT TO THE MOTOR <BREATH> NO MATTER W WAY IT GOING IT WILL JUST GO A DIFFERENT WAY
THE UM <BREATH> MOTOR DOESN'T REALLY UM IT GOES THE A DIFFERENT WAY <BREATH> SO SINCE THE BATTERY IS FLIPPED
IT LOOKED THE SAME
<BREATH> THE BATTERY IS THERE AND THE WIRE SINCE IT'S CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULBS IS GOING THROUGH IS GOING <BREATH> TO THE LIGHT BULB
AND THE LIGHT BULB <BREATH> CAN FEEL IT COMING THROUGH SO IT TURNS ON AND IT GOES DOWN THROUGH THERE'S ANOTHER WIRE AND IT GOES BACK <BREATH> AND THEN IT GO TO THE NEXT ONE AND BACK TO THE BATTERY <BREATH>
TODAY WE UM TOOK A MOTOR AND A BATTERY <BREATH> AND WE TRIED TO MAKE THE MOTOR GO THEN WE TOOK THE MOTOR AND A BATTERY WITH THE SWITCH AND TRIED TO MAKE THE SWITCH TURN ON THE MOTOR AND THE BATTERY <BREATH>
<BREATH> THESE LITTLE MICROSCOPIC UM <BREATH> THING MICROSCOPIC UM
YOU CAN'T BEND A METER STICK AND YOU HAVE TO BEND IT TO GET AROUND YOUR HEAD UNLESS YOU'RE SOME SUPER S PERSON SO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DO THAT SO YOU'LL HAVE TO PICK A METER TAPE
UM PRETTY GOOD
<BREATH> WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT THE LENGTH OF SOME OF OUR BODY PARTS AND WE HAD AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT OUR ARMS ARE A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN OUR BODY'S HEIGHT BUT IT'S ONLY LIKE EIGHTEEN CENTIMETERS HIGH WELL IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING TO FIND OUT HOW LONG OUR ARMS ARE COMPARED TO OUR BODIES AND MID WAY YOUR ELBOWS TO YOUR WRIST
UM I DIDN'T REALLY GET TO DO ANY OTHER BODY PARTS EXCEPT FOR THE ONES I'VE TOLD YOU
YOU GET A MORE PRECISE ESTIMATE
WELL THIS BOY HE IS EXACTLY ONE METER AND WITH A HE'S PROBABLY A METER AND TEN INCHES I MEAN CENTIMETERS TEN CENTIMETERS SO WITH IF HE STRAIGHTENS THIS ONE OUT HE'LL GET THE SAME THING CAUSE HE'S LIKE ABOUT ONE INCH OFF
OKAY SO WE USED MY HAND AND FROM MY WRIST TO TO MY TO THE TIP OF MY PINKIE IT'S ABOUT SEVEN INCHES AND FOR MY PINKIE NAIL IS EXACTLY A CENTIMETER SO I CAN USE THAT TO MEASURE A METER BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THAT TO MEASURE A HUNDRED PINKIES
I NOTICED THAT ROBBIE'S HEIGHT IS TWO CENTIMETERS I MEAN TWO METERS AND ROBBIE'S ARM *SPAN* IS WAY SMALLER ONE METER AND FIFTY SIX IN CENTIMETERS SO OUR ROBBIE HAS REALLY SHORT ARMS
WELL FIRST YOU'LL HAVE TO THINK THERE'S A CLOCK ABOVE ME AND THE IT'S ABOUT I'D SAY A FOOT AND IF I TOOK A METER STICK OR OR OH WELL IT'S LIKE THIRTEEN INCHES I KNOW IT WOULD JUST YEAH
W I'M I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT A REFERENCE IS
<BREATH> UM HER I'LL SAY PINKIES FINGER I PINKIE FINGER IS ONE CENTIMETER EXAC-
UM IT WILL BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE NEXT TIME YOU'LL SAY MEASURE THAT PERSON LIKE THIS LITTLE BOY WHO I AM GOING TO CALL MARK UM THE NEXT TIME YOU MEASURE MARK MARK'S GOING TO BE THE SAME HEIGHT UNLESS HE GROWS IN THE NEXT FIVE DAYS BUT HE PROBABLY IS HE'S ANYWAYS IF YOU MEASURE HIM IN THE MORNING AND THEN YOU MEASURE HIM IN THE EVENING HE'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD GUESS WHAT HIS HEIGHT IS OR YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW
THIS TABLE IS EXACTLY ONE METER AND TWENTY THREE CENTIMETERS OR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE CENTIMETERS AND UM IT TAKES A WHOLE METER TO DO DO PART OF IT BUT OH NO YOU HAVE SOME MORE SO YOU CAN GO ON THE CENTIMETERS PART OF THAT AND TO MEASURE THAT
WITH LIKE A METER OR A RULER OR A YARD STICK
UM WELL YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOUR MEASURING TAPE IS STRAIGHT AND IT'LL BE MORE EASY TO DO ANY EVERYTHING WHEN YOU UM UM <LAUGH> I FORGOT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY SORRY
IT WILL GET YOU THE BEST ANSWER POSSIBLE SO IF IT BEGINS AT ZERO YOU HAVE TO END SOMEWHERE YOU CAN'T JUST GO ON UNTIL YOU GET TO INFI- INFINITY SO IT HAS TO LAND AT FOR INSTANCE FOR THIS MATTER TWENTY THREE
TELL ME IT TELLS ME THAT HER'S HER IF WE WERE GOING TO GO TO A METER SHE WOULD HAVE TO PUT HER PINKIE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE FI SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT AND SO ON TO A HUNDRED
UNDER YOUR ELBOW TO YOUR WRIST
TO MEASURE REALLY BIG THINGS OR REALLY SMALL THINGS
WELL WE MEASU- WE ALL WANT TO MEASURE KINSEY WHO'S A REALLY SMALL GIRL OR NICK WHOSE A REALLY SMALL BOY AND CAUSE NICK IS ABOUT ONE CENT ONE NOT A CENTIMETER ONE METER AND KINSEY'S ABOUT A METER TOO
ROBBIE'S NOSE IS ONE PINKIE LONG IT'S PINKIE'S FINGERS FINGER LENGTH
I HAD MY PARTNER HOLD THE METER TAPE OVER HERE WITH HIS ARMS STRAIGHT AND THEN OVER HERE WITH HIS ARMS STRAIGHT AND HIS WAS EXACTLY A METER
I HAVE TO GO GOODBYE
IT'S THE GUY WHEN IT WAS UM FOLDING UM HE WAS UM IT WAS ACTUALLY LIKE TO HIS PANTS AND THEN IF YOU WENT A LITTLE IF YOU STRAIGHTENED IT OUT IT WAS TO ABOUT PART OF HIS SHOE <BREATH> AND THEN HIS THE REST OF HIS SHOE IS EIGHTEEN CENTIMETERS WHICH WOULD MAKE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN CENTIMETERS
IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE HAD TO MEASURE HEIGHT BECAUSE UM WE HAD TO LINE UP UP WE HAD TO KNOW WHO THE PERSON WHO WE WERE STANDING NEXT TO'S HEIGHT OR ELSE WE WOULDN'T BE DOING IT WE WOULDN'T BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE IN LINE SO IT WAS FUN YET HARD TO DO IT
GOODBYE I'M REALLY SORRY TO SAY THIS BUT GOODBYE
<BREATH> YOU HAVE TO UM CH-
THEY UM GO DOWN IN <BREATH> UM TEMPE
YOU COULD JUST COUNT HOW MUCH I GUESS BY FIVES OR
ONE MINUTE THAT'S ALL IT TOOK FROM FIFTEEN TO
IT GETS COLDER
IT GOES UP WHEN IT'S HOTTER DOWN WHEN IT'S COLDER
THE TEMPERATURE IN THE UM T
LE X'S OR DOTS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
<BREATH> UM IT CHANGED REALLY QUICKLY I GUESS
<BREATH> I NEED STAR *BOURS* BURST SOR
IT GOT IT WAS STARTED AT TWENTY AND THEN IT WENT TO
JUST BY COUNTING BY TENS OR FIFTY
IT GOES UP IF IT'S <FP> WARMER AND IT GOES DOWN IF IT'S HOTTER
UM YOU HAVE TO MARK THE TEMPERATURE AND HOW LONG IT TOOK TO GET THERE AND FROM THIS IT TOOK MORE THAN AN HOUR IT TOOK AN HOUR AND A HALF TO DO THIS WHICH IS WAY LONGER THAN IT SHOULD
UM MEASUREMENT AND DIFFERENT UNITS OF MEASUREMENT LIKE TEMPERATURE MASS AND CAMPAS- AND LENGTH
IT GOES UP UP ALL THE WAY UP <BREATH>
GOES AND THEN UP
THEY'RE DIFFERENT UM TEMPERATURES
AWESOME I HEARD WE'RE TAKING UH THIS IS OUR LAST DAY ACTUALLY SO I'M NOT REALLY SO PSYCHED BUT <BREATH> GOODBYE TO YOU AFTER SH
THE UM NOT REALLY HOT ONES ARE BLUE AND THE OTHER ONES ARE RED
UM WE COULD SHOW LIKE ONE MINUTE FIFTEEN DEGREES WRITE THAT DOWN <BREATH> AND TWO MIN ZERO DEGREES WRITE THAT DOWN
OKAY <BREATH> DOING GOOD
WE DREW IT ON GRAPH PAPER
WELL YOU PUT ON IT TIME AND TEMPERATURE
WHA- <BREATH> SORRY I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU REPEAT
IT GOT FROM FIFTEEN TO ZERO
<BREATH> HOW MUCH TIME HOW MUCH TIME IT TOOK TO CHANGE I GUESS
TEN MINUTES
<BREATH> IT GOT REALLY COLDER IT GOT TWENTY DEGREE COLDER
IT GOES UP BECAUSE THE ICE IS MELTING
I *COUNT* ZERO TEN TWENTY
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
<FP> I STAND EXACT
<BREATH> UH EIGHT OR SEVEN UM INCHES LONG UM YOU COULD DO ADDITION WITH THAT <BREATH>
HONESTLY I DON'T KNOW
UM LIKE SOMETIMES IN CONTESTS THEY MAKE YOU ESTIMATE YOU NEED TO KNOW THE SIZE HOW LONG THIS ANACONDA WAS FOR INSTANCE YOU'D NEED TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF THE ANACONDA
YOU HAVE TO MEASURE IT MANY MANY MANY TIMES TO JUST GET THE REAL ANSWER CAUSE MAYBE ONE TIME YOU MEASURED WRONG AND MAYBE THE OTHER TIME YOU MEASURE IT RIGHT BUT YOU'RE NOT SURE SO YOU HAVE TO DO IT MANY TIMES TO MAKE SURE YOU GET ONE ANSWER
BYE
I NOTICED THAT UM AS WE GOT CLOSER AND C UM AS WE GOT AS THEY GOT CLOSER TO IT AS WE WENT UP THE THE LINE OF WOODS THE DECIMETER GOT CLOSER AND BY THEN THE CENTIMETER GOT CLOSER AND THEN UNTIL MIL MILLIMETER AND THAT SCREWED UP THE WHOLE THING
UM YOU USE IT MORE BECAUSE IT HAS LIKE TWO THINGS THAT YOU USE A LOT LIKE CENTIMETERS AND METERS METERS ARE LIKE REALLY BIG THINGS AND YOU USUALLY SEE A LOT OF BIG THINGS AND METER AND CENTIMETERS EXCUSE ME FOR SAYING METERS UM ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY SMALL AND YOU SEE A LOT OF UM CENTIMETERS
YOU MIGHT DO IT UM TO GET IT IN YOUR MIND CAUSE UM I I DID A BOOK THAT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF PAPER AND I WAS AWFUL AT ALL IN MY ESTIMATE AND THEN I WENT TO THE PAPER AND I WAS MORE AND AFTER FAILING ON THE BOOK I TRIED THE PAPER AND THEN MY ESTIMATE WAS ALMOST EXACTLY RIGHT SO IF YOU TRY IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER WITH ONE THING IT'S GOING TO GET STUCK IN YOUR MIND THEN YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO UM IT'S GOING TO REALLY STICK IN YOUR MIND WHEN YOU UM MEASURE SOMETHING ABOUT THE SIZE FOR THAT
<BREATH> UM IT HELPS YOU WITH LIKE WELL IT'S LET ME SEE HOW LONG THIS PIECE OF PAPER IS I'M GOING TO SEE IT'S TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY CENTIMETERS FIFTY CENTIMETERS IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY EASY TO USE YOUR HAND
TEN MILLIMETERS
UM YOU CAN MEASURE REALLY BIG THINGS OR REALLY SMALL THINGS AND IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO MEASURE WITH CENTIMETERS IF YOU'RE MEASURING LIKE A UM WATER BOTTLE OR SOMETHING
THAT'S KIND OF HARD
WELL THIS IS AN OLD SAYING PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT AND I HAVE TO AGREE WITH IT
<BREATH> UM THINGS THAT HELP YOU ESTIMATE LIKE YOUR HAND UM SOMETIMES YOUR FEET <LAUGH> UM SOMETIMES WELL A LOT OF TIMES YOUR PINKIE AND THUMB OR YOUR PINKIE SO THOSE ARE A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE USUALLY USE TO MEASURE THINGS WITH A SCIENTIFIC GUEST
A LOGICAL GUESS
METERS ARE USED IN SCIENTIFIC STUDY FOR LIKE REALLY LONG THINGS OR REALLY SHORT THINGS AND YEAH
GOOD
<BREATH> METERS ARE A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS UM METER IS ONE KILOMETER AND THAT'S ALL I KNOW
UM WELL YOU CAN LIKE I KNOW WHAT A PAP HOW LONG A PAPER IS SO I CAN ESTIMATE A PAPER AND IF YOU HAVE A BOOK IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A PAPER BUT NOT EXACTLY YOU CAN MAKE A REALLY GO
PRACTICING UM WILL HELP YOU GET BETTER AT SOMETHING BY UM BY UM WELL IT'LL GIVE YOU MO PRACTICE WILL GIVE YOU MORE EXPERIENCE WITH THINGS LIKE SAY YOU'RE REALLY SCARED TO PLAY HIDE AND GO SEEK AND THEN YOU PRA- OR SOME GAME AND THEN YOU PRACTICE AND PRACTICE DOING IT WITH PEOPLE YOU KNOW WILL HELP YOU AND YOU WEREN'T AFRAID YOU PRACTICED TO DO IT
WELL WHAT OUR TEACHER SAYS IS USE YOUR PINKIE FOR CENTIMETERS AND YOUR THUMB AND PINKIE FOR A DECIMETERS
HOW LONG THE DOOR KNOB IS FROM THE FLOOR
IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT UM LIKE YESTERDAY WE HAD TO ESTIMATE ABOUT HOW LONG SOMETHING WAS AND THEN WE HAD TO REALLY MEASURE IT AND I ONLY GOT A FEW TIMES EXACTLY RIGHT SO IT'S KIND OF AN ESTIMATE IS NOT EXACTLY WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE BUT IT YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE AND AND IT'S BY TO THAT
WELL ESTIMATING IS REALLY WITH PRACTICE AND I LIKE TO CALL IT MEMORY MEMORY LIKE THE GAME CAUSE YOU REALLY HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SIZE OF THINGS CAUSE WE'RE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE A PAPER IN FRONT OF YOU TO ESTIMATE WITH
UM SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE WHOLE WORLD AGREED ON UM THAT THE WHOLE U WORLD USES SO AND THE U S IS THE ONLY PEOPLE STATE THAT USES UM A DIFFERENT PUT UM A DIFFERENT UM UNIT OF MEASUR-
UM YOU WOULD USE IT CAUSE IT WOULD GIVE YOU AN EXACT IT WOULD GIVE YOU THE EXACT ANSWER AND IT WOULDN'T JUST MAKE AN ESTIMATE YOU WOULD EXACTLY KNOW WHAT THIS IS <BREATH>
MEASUREMENT
<BREATH> SAY YOU WERE RUNNING A FIVE K RACE LIKE MY FRIENDS THAT WE JUST DID A WHILE AGO AND YOU WERE REALLY SLOW YOU WOULD HAVE TO PRACTICE RUNNING AROUND THAT FIELD AROUND THAT FIELD AND IT GOES WITH THE MATH YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE WITH THAT NUMBER WITH THAT NUMBER ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND AND LIKE THIS USED TO BE REALLY HARD FOR ME EIGHT PLUS EIGHT EQUALS SIXTEEN NOW WE CAN DO THAT VERY EASILY
GOODBYE
THEY ALL START WITH ONE
THEY ARE PART OF THE METRIC SYSTEM OF THE WORLD
<BREATH> UM LIKE SAY IT WAS SOMETHING TWO HANDS AND THAT HAND IS TEN INCHES WELL THEN YOUR HAND THEN YOU COULD GO TEN TWENTY TEN TWENTY AND YOU WOULD HAVE UM A TWENTY INCH THING
ESTIMATING IS UM ABOUT A LOGICAL GUESS I ALWAYS SAY UM BUT OTHER PEOPLE SAY UM WELL KIND OF LIKE WHAT I SAY <BREATH> A LOGICAL GUESS
UM HOW LONG A DOORKNOB IS FROM THE FLOOR UM IT UM A CABINET SHELF UM MY CLASSMATE NICK <LAUGH> HE IS ABOUT AS TALL AS A METER HE'S A LITTLE BIT TALLER
UM NOT MUCH
HEAVIER THAN THE DRY SPONGE UM PROBABLY THE MASS WOULD BE UM S SOMETHING ALL A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THE SPONGE <BREATH>
BYE MIRACLE
SO YEAH
GRAMS GRAMS GRAM GRA-
I DIDN'T FIND OUT MUCH I ACTUALLY PRETTY MUCH KNEW ALL THAT SO CAUSE IT EXPLAINED MOST OF THE STUFF YOU DIDN'T REALLY EXPLAIN ANYTHING NO OFFENSE OR ANYTHING COLLEGE PROFESSORS
HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH HOW MUCH MORE THEY WEIGH HI ROBBIE
KING
<BREATH> UM WELL HERE'S THE ONE BASIC THING THAT SPONGES DO CLEAN UP UM ANOTHER THING THAT YOU COULD DO WITH SPONGES IS IF YOU NEE WELL THIS GOES WITH THE BASIC <BREATH> YOU COULD UM WEIGH HOW MUCH WATER IT HAD YOU ARE REALLY S IF YOU REALLY REALLY LIKE
UM IT'S REALLY DRY AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WEIGH THAT MUCH
UM IT'S GOING TO WEIGH A LITTLE MORE BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE SOAKED SPONGE <BREATH>
<BREATH> MYSTERY MYSTERY IS RIGHT THERE AND CIRCLE IT AND THEN RIGHT HERE'S
NOT SO USEFUL AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO CLEAN IT
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING UM DIFFERENT LENGTHS AND MASS
SO SO <BREATH>
WE UM USED GRAM PIECES AND WE PUT THE SPONGE IN AND WE WENT ONE UH NO TWO STILL NO THREE UH AND JACLYN SAID OH IT'S BALANCE AND WE'RE LIKE NO AND THEN WE WENT FOUR <BREATH> EXACTLY FOUR <BREATH> <BREATH>
<BREATH> UM YOU CAN KNOW HOW MUCH IF YOU COULD KNOW HOW MUCH UM
ONE GRAM TWO GRAM THREE GRAM FOUR GRAM THE DRY SPONGE IS THREE GRAMS ONE GRAM TWO GRAM THREE GRAM FOUR GRAM FIVE GRAM SIX GRAM SEVEN GRAM EIGHT GRAM NINE GRAM TEN GRAM ELEVEN GRAM TWELVE GRAM THIRTEEN GRAM FOURTEEN GRAM FIFTEEN GRAM AND THE ANSWER THREE GRAMS THREE THIRTEEN GRAMS IS A LOT
THE DRY SPONGE IS EXACTLY THREE GRAMS
IT SIXTEEN GRAMS IS THAT CORRECT
<BREATH> DRY SPONGE WET SPONGE SOAKED SPONGE <BREATH>
<BREATH> YOU PUT ONE GRAM PIECE TWO GRAM PIECE THREE GRAM PIECE FOUR GRAM PIECE FIVE GRAM PIECE <BREATH> ONE GRAM TWO GRAM THREE GRAM FOUR GRAM FIVE GRAMS AND SAY IT WAS TEN GRAMS YOU YOU WOULD HAVE ONE TEN GRAM PIECE AM I RIGHT <BREATH>
IF YOU SUBSTRACT AWAY THE DRY THE DRY SPONGE FROM THE WET SPONGE YOU GET THIRTEEN
<BREATH> WELL HERE'S WHAT WE DID SO WE WEIGHED THE DRY SPONGE WHICH WAS FOUR GRAMS FOR US AND THEN WE THE WET SPONGE WAS FORTY SIX AND WE SUBTRACTED FOUR FROM FORTY SIX WHICH GOT US TO A GOOD SUM FORTY SIX FORTY TWO
<BREATH> THE WET SPONGE IS SOAKED SO IT'S GONNA BE HEAVIER THAN THE WET SPONGE HEAVIER THAN THE DRY SPONGE UM BECAUSE WATER LIKE IF YOU'VE EVER HAD A TOWEL AND YOU TRY TO SLING IT OVER YOUR SHOULDER THE FIRST TIME IT'S EASY UM WHEN YOU DO IT THE SECOND TIME IT'S REALLY HARD BECAUSE IT'S CAUSE MAYBE IT FOUND THE BATHTUB OR THE POOL
<BREATH> UM I'M I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IT'S THE SOAKED SPONGE OR WET SPONGE BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT I DON'T THINK IT'S DRY SPONGE
IT'LL STOP OBSERVING
<BREATH> THE DRY SPONGE IS THREE GRAMS
UM WE HAVEN'T DONE MUCH WORK WITH SPONGES YET WELL NOT LIKE CLEANING UP ANY MESSES OR ANYTHING SO YEAH
WEIGHING HOW MUCH SOAP YOU HAVE IF YOU'RE NOT SURE AND YOU NEED IT UM HOW MUCH YOUR BABY WEIGHS IF IT'S SMALL
ISN'T IT VOLUME MASS AND A BALANCE
UM BAKING YOU NEED A PRECISE AMOUNT OF WATER EVAPORATION TEST LIKE THAT <BREATH>
GRAM PIECES ANOTHER CUP A LOT OF IT'S
SMALL OBJECTS OR LIQUID
<BREATH> THE CUP AND THE WATER IF YOU'RE MEASURING THE CUP WITH THE WATER AND THEN IF YOU SUBTRACT THE WEIGHT OF THE CUP YOU'RE JUST WEIGHING THE WATER <BREATH> YEAH
FOR MEDICINE
UM THAT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN SORRY
SMALL DISK
YOU COULD WEIGH THE WATER
SMALL OBJECTS OR LIQUID OBJECTS
<BREATH> UM THEY'RE EXACTLY THE SAME EIGHTY EIGHT MILLIME- LITERS EIGHTY EIGHT MILLILITERS
COOKING BAKING I'VE USED THAT FOR A LOT OF THINGS
IT'S A MINIMUM IT'S SMALLER THAN THE METER <BREATH>
I CAN'T WHAT'S IT'S CALLED BUT IT'S USED FOR MEDICINE AND WATER AND OTHER THINGS
THE SANDALWOOD BOX AND STUFF
ONE HUNDRED
UM I AN AN EMPTY CUP WE HAVEN'T DONE ANY WI- WI- WITH AN EMPTY CUP
<BREATH> THE MILLILITERS <BREATH>
<BREATH> THIS THERMOMETER'S UM COUNTING BY TENS THIS IS COUNTING BY ONES AND THIS IS COUNTING BY HUNDREDS
MULTIPLYING IT BY A HUNDRED
VIAL A MEASURING CUP A MEASURING SPOON
UM YOU COULD GET IF YOU PUT UM THE WATER THAT YOU COULD HAVE
A BALANCE <BREATH>
MILLILITERS ARE SMALLER I GUESS OR THEY'RE BIGGER I HAVE NO IDEA SORRY <BREATH>
MEASURE GRAVEL YOU CAN MEASURE A LOT OF SMALL OBJECTS WITH US
THEY'D GET UM DIFFERENT ANSWERS UM GROUP ONE WOULD GET BIG ANSWERS GROUP TWO WOULD GET TEENY TINY ANSWERS TEEN <BREATH> <BREATH> <BREATH> <BREATH> YEAH
WELL WHEN YOU WEIGH THE CUP AND SO IT WAS FOUR GRAMS AND THEN YOU WEIGH THE CUP WITH THE WATER AND SAY IT WAS SIXTY FIVE SO YOU WOULD SUBTRACT THE UM GRAMS OF THE CUP WHICH WOULD BE FOUR SO THAT WOULD BE SIXTY ONE <BREATH>
GOOD
UM THEY GOT FOUR GRAM PIECES AND THEY GOT NINE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT <BREATH>
THE NUMBERS THAT THE SYRINGE HOLDS IT WAS REALLY FUN TO SCROLL UP
IT MIGHT TELL YOU HOW MUCH YOU SHOULD HAVE FOR LEMONADE AND PUNCH AT A PARTY WHICH I AM GOING TO HAVE ONE AT TONIGHT A PARTY
INTO A MILLILITER I GUESS AND A KILOLITER OR SOMETHING
NUMBER TWO IS SMALLER THAN NUMBER ONE SO IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO HOLD LESS WATER UM IT'S NOT THICKER SO IT'S NOT GONNA HOLD MORE WATER SO
BYE
IT'S A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
IT'S UM A MEASURING CUP WITH A HUNDRED MILLIMETERS WORTH OF WATER I KNOW THOSE FACTS BECAUSE I ALWAYS COOK WITH MY MOM AND IT'S REALLY GOOD TO KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HAVE WELL THAT'S A THOUSAND MILLIMETERS TIME IS <BREATH> ELEVEN <BREATH>
YOUR VOICE IS LOUD TODAY BUT I'M GOOD <BREATH>
ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS AND THAT'S HOW THE SPACE THAT THIS CUP CONTAINS
THEY'RE TEN MILLIMETERS
WELL IF YOU HAD LIKE A STICK AND YOU PUT IT IN A STREAM AND THEN YOU UM SAW YOU COULD MAKE AN ESTIMATE ON THE WET LINE AND THE DRY LINE SO YOU COULD DO THAT
M IT'S TWO GRADUATED CYLINDERS THAT AND THAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER SO AND IF YOU HAVE A SHORTER BUT LONGER A SHORTER BUT WIDER ONE YOU COULD IT WOULD BE TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS
UM AN ESTIMATE WOULD REALLY BE GOOD IF YOU MEASURED LIKE WHEN YOU'RE AT HOME AND NOW YOU'RE CAMPING IF YOU WERE AT HOME AND YOU DECIDED TO M AND FOR HOMEWORK YOU HAD TO MEASURE A BOOK AND THEN YOU SAW THAT THE STICKS WATER WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THAT BOOK YOU COULD USE THAT INFORMATION AND MAYBE IT WAS A LITTLE SMALLER SO YOU COULD SAY WELL MY BOOK AT HOME WAS FIFTY MILLILITERS SO I THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE FORTY EIGHT
TWO HEATED CYLINDER <BREATH>
THEY ACTUALLY ALL HOLD THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER UM BUT UM THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZES SKINNIER BUT TALLER WIDER BUT SMALLER SKINNIER BUT TALLER UM WIDER BUT SMALLER
A BEAKER A SYRINGE MAYBE NOT FOR GRAVEL BUT FOR OTHER THING AND A GRADUATED CYLINDER
UM PROBABLY THINGS THAT WE DON'T WANT A LARGE AMOUNT OF CAUSE A THOUSAND MILLILITERS IS MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND ONE MILLIME- LITER <LAUGH> IS A LOT LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND
UM ONE'S TO B AND ONE'S TO D
THOSE ARE MILLIMETERS <BREATH>
UM PROBABLY LIKE GRAVEL LIKE YOU WANT TO PUT IN A FISH TANK OR UM LIQUID YOU WANT THAT YOU WANT TO DRINK AND YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH AND YOU WANT TO HAVE WHICH IS GOING TO SOUND REALLY WEIRD COMING FROM ME BUT IF YOU WANT SEVENTY MILLIME- LITERS <LAUGH> I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD WANT THAT BUT MAYBE I WOULD
UM YOU COULD GO A THEN B IS DOUBLE A B C IS DOUBLE B SO ON IS FI IS MORE THAN B AND SO ON
WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT THE UM HOW HOW MUCH WATER UM WATER WATER COULD CONTAIN IN A CUP AND UM IT WAS ACTUALLY REALLY FUN CAUSE ME AND WATER MY PARENTS SAY I HAVE A BAD REPUTATION BUT I JUST TH THINK WE HAVE A MESSY REPUTATION <LAUGH>
IT I FORGOT IF IT'S I FORGOT
UM THE S THE SPACE AT THE WATER OR ANYTHING CONTAINS IN A CUP A BEAKER A GRADUATED CYLINDER A UM WHAT A ALL RIGHT A SYRINGE
THEY ARE EITHER TALLER BUT SKINNIER OR SMALLER BUT WIDER
EVERY TEN UM <BREATH> EVERY MILLILITER <BREATH> <BREATH>
IT'S A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLILITERS UM SO YOU JUST TAKE THE WATER OUT OF THE CUP I GUESS IS WHAT THAT'S SHOWING
UM I TOLD YOU A LOT A LOT A LOT OF STUFF UM BUT ONE OTHER THING IS THAT UM SYRINGES CAN SQUIRT MEDICINE UM IF YOU WERE REALLY BAD COLD AND YOU NEED TO SQUIRT IT INTO THE BACK OF YOUR THROAT YOU CAN USE A SYRINGE
WELL IF SOMETHING'S TALLER BUT SKINNIER AND IF SOMETHING'S SMALLER BUT FATTER UM THEY ACTUALLY CONTAIN THE SAME AMOUNT OF WHATEVER
IT'LL BE FILLED TO THE BRIM <BREATH>
COULD USE A SYRINGE YOU COULD BUY A SYRINGE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ONE AND THEN YOU COULD GO FILL IT UP TO
TO MAKE WATER PRECISE MEASUREMENTS OR ANY LIQUID OR UM SMALL OBJECT <BREATH>
SYRINGE UM DOESN'T GET YOU THE PRECISE CAUSE IT GOES THE PRECISE TH MEASUREMENT CAUSE IT GOES UP TO FIS UM UP TO FIFTY BUT I THINK UM IF YOU SQUIRT THE SYRINGE INTO THE GRADUATED CYLINDER IT'LL DO IT PERFECT
IT'S TWO HUNDRED LI MILLILITERS STILL SO UM IT'S THE SAME AMOUNT IF YOU TURN IT THIS WAY IT'S JUST AS TALL
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER IT'S TALLER OR SMALLER IT JUST MATTERS HOW WIDE IT I OR HOW WIDE IT IS
UM THE SPACE THE WATER CONTAINS IN THE CUP
UM I DESCRIBED I DESCRIBED IT UM LIKE THE SPACE THAT SOMETHING CONTAINS
IT SHOWS EVERY TEN MILLILITERS UM IT'S UM IT LOOKS LIKE A GLASS ONLY AS THINNER AND SMALLER PROBABLY AND IT HAS A LITTLE STAND
WE USE A SPOON BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SLOW ONE <BREATH> TWO THREE
UM WE CAN JUST USE A SYRINGE WE CAN JUST POUR THE CUP UM ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT TOOLS LIKE A SPOON OR A STRAW BUT THE STRAW IT DOES NOT SOUND LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO MOST PEOPLE NOT EVEN ME
LO MY NAME IS SARAH <BREATH> UM I'M REALLY EXCITED TO DO THIS WITH YOU SO
UM I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT WE'RE DOING IN SCIENCE AND UM SOMETIMES I JUST FEEL LIKE I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND SO I THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO REALLY HELP ME AND I'M REALLY EXCITED TO GET STARTED SO UM I JUST WANT TO REALLY I JUST REALLY WANT TO DO THIS OKAY
<BREATH> THEY MIGHT COME UP WITH A DECISION TO MAKE A MEASUREMENT STANDARD
<BREATH> YOU NEED TO UM MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STRAWS ARE THE SAME LENGTH GROUP B'S STRAWS ARE SHORTER AND GROUP A'S STRAWS ARE MUCH LONGER SO YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STRAWS ARE THE SAME LENGTH TO REALLY DO THIS PROBLEM
I SO SAY I WANTED TO MEASURE THIS COMPUTER I WOULD PROBABLY USE THE UM RULER WHICH HAS A FOOT AND INCHES AND CENTIMETERS
YES VERY CLEARLY <BREATH>
CENTIMETERS
YOU COULD USE METERS UM OR UM YOU COULD USE CENTIMETERS AND THAT WAY YOU DID IT IF AN ENGLISH KID DID IN SHANGHAI PEOPLE IN SHANGHAI WOULD UNDERSTAND TOO
HOW BIG IT IS
UM THEY WERE FIGURED OUT CAUSE EVERYBODY MIGHT HAVE BEEN USING ME LIKE YARDS AND FEET AND THEY AND INCHES AND THEY COULDN'T TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ON THE GLOBE SO THEY PROBABLY CREATED THIS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTOOD MATH THE SAME WAY
<BREATH> UM A METER HAS A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS I MEAN ONE HUNDRED AND IT IS USED FOR VERY LONG OBJECTS OR VERY SHORT Q
UM GROUP UM B'S ARE UM A LOT MORE THAN GROUP A'S BUT ON THE FIRST ONE IT'S TWENTY STRAWS WHERE ON I MEAN B'S IS TWENTY STRAWS WHEREAS IN A'S IT'S SEVEN STRAWS AND IN A'S GROUP STANDARDS IT'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE AND IT'S HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE OVER THERE SO THE FIRST COLUMN OF BOTH OF THEM IS DIFFERENT THE SECOND COLUMN IS THE SAME
YES AND I'M REALLY EXCITED TO START
SO YOU COULD UM GO TO ANOTHER PERSON TAKE YOUR STRAW AND THEIRS WOULD BE TALLER OR SMALLER AND THEN YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND OUR TEACHER DID SAY THAT SHE CHECKED US SOME OF US FELT KIND OF WEIRD THAT OUR TEACHER HAD CHECKED US
<BREATH> UM HOW LONG THINGS ARE AND HOW BIG THEY ARE <BREATH>
I NOTICED THAT THE ROBOT IS HITTING THE FLOOR AND IT HITS JUST THE MIDDLE LINE OF THE DOOR KNOB ON THE DOOR SO THE DOOR KNOB IS A METER ABOVE THE FLOOR
UM WELL AN EASY WAY TO USE CENTIMETERS WOULD BE WITH A METER STICK OR A UM A RULER BUT THE HARD WAY WOULD BE TO USE INCHES IF YOU HAD A RULER THAT DIDN'T MEASURE OR A METER STICK THAT DIDN'T MEASURE IN CENTIMETERS
UM THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS I CAN SAY BUT THE THING THAT I'M GOING TO SAY IS THAT YOU COULD USE A METER AS LIKE YOU COULD
I'VE GOT IT TO WORK
UM YOU CAN MEASURE UM YOU CAN S IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT YOU WOULD MEASURE SOMETHING BIG BUT SOMETIMES YOU MEASURE WITH THE CENTIMETERS PART OF IT AND YOU *MEASURE* SOMETHING SMALL
IT SHOWS HOW LONG THE METER IS AND UM HOW MANY CENTIMETERS ARE IN A METER
UM LENGTH IS UM UP AND DOWN OR HOW TALL
NO
YES
YES
<BREATH> WE HAD TO USE STRAWS TO MEASURE OUR DESK AND UM WE HAD TO NOT USE UM ANYTHING BUT UM <BREATH> THOSE STRAWS SO UM THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE DID AND ALL OF OUR ANSWERS CAME OUT DIFFERENT PRETTY MUCH AND THAT'S BECAUSE OUR STRAWS WERE DIFFERENT LENGTHS
UM MEASUREMENT STANDARDS ARE THINGS THAT WE USE ALL OVER THE WORLD AND EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD IF YOU SAY I WANT TO MEASURE THIS IN CENTIMETERS WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN SO IT'S BASICALLY WHAT YOU USE TO MEASURE IN A BIG GROUP <BREATH>
WE'VE BEEN DOING UM MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
THE STANDARD UNITS AND ALSO INCHES AND UM <BREATH> FEET <LAUGH>
WEIGHT WEIGHING <BREATH>
IT'S A SMALL GRAM I'M GUESSING
<BREATH> WELL IF YOU KNOW HOW MUCH A PAPER CLIP WEIGHS THEN YOU CAN PUT YOUR PENCIL IN THE BALANCE OH I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN MY STRATEGY I'M SORRY
<BREATH> FIVE GRAMS EQUALS A FIVE GRAM BLOCK EQUALS FIVE ONE GRAM BLOCKS TEN GRAM BLOCK EQUALS TWO FIVE GRAM BLOCKS EQUAL THAT EQUALS TEN ONE GRAM BLOCK TWENTY GRAM BLOCK EQUALS TWO TEN GRAM BLOCKS WHICH EQUALS FOUR FIVE GRAM BLOCKS WHICH EQUALS
GRAMS ARE UM A UNIT OF MASS OF WEIGHT <BREATH>
OH WE DID THE SHEET PAPER TODAY YOU SHOULD USE BIG BIG BIG ONES CAUSE THE ORANGE WHEN YOU HOLD IT IT'S HEAVY SO I THINK YOU SHOULD USE A LOT TWENTIES A LOT OF TENS AND A LOT OF FIVES BUT NOT SO MANY ONES
IT'S EASIER CAUSE IT'S MORE EFFICIENT IT'LL NOT TAKE SO MUCH TIME SO IF YOU'RE TEACHER SET UM FOR HOMEWORK AND THERE WAS THIS REALLY GOOD SHOW ON TV THAT YOU HAD TO WATCH <BREATH> PLEASE WEIGH A METAL CHIP AND TAKE THESE UM GRAM PIECES AND I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS BALANCE AND DO IT IT WOULD IF YOU WENT ONE NO TWO NO THREE NO FOUR NO FIVE NO SIX X NO SEVEN KIND OF EIGHT PERFECT YOU COULD JUST DO A FIVE GRAM ONE AND THREE AND THREE ONE GRAMS AND THEN YOU WOULD WATCH YOUR SHOW WITHOUT A PROBLEM AND YOU WOULD HAVE YOUR UM TOTAL HOMEWORK DONE AND YOU'D GET A GOOD GRADE
UM WELL HERE'S THERE ARE TWO THINGS YOU COULD DO THE HARD WAY AND GET AND BUY MORE GRAM PIECES OR THE EASY WAY AND IF YOUR DAD HAS PAPER CLIPS PROBABLY JUMBOS YOU COULD U UM BALANCE THOSE WITH SOME OF THEM AND YOU KNOW THE WEIGHT AND THEN YOU KNOW
WOOD CHIP I'M SORRY FOR THE PAUSE BIG PAUSE
THOUSAND GRAMS <BREATH>
THEY TELL YOU HOW MANY GRAMS ARE THE WOOD CHIP WHICH IS THREE UM THEY TELL YOU UM IF I WANTED TO HAVE A FIVE GRAM PIECE OF WOOD THIS WOULD NOT AND I THOUGHT OH THIS WOOD PIECE IS THE PERFECT ONE IT WOULDN'T BE THE PERFECT ONE CAUSE THE WOOD CHIP'S ONLY THREE GRAMS
IT'S THREE HUNDRED TWENTY GRAMS SO THREE BAGS OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY AND THAT'S STILL A LITTLE OFF SO YOU NEED A BIT OF FIVE
WELL YOU'RE TRYING TO BALANCE SOMETHING
WEIGHING HEAVIER THINGS
IT IS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY GRAMS
SMALL PAPER CLIP UM AS FOUR FOR THE PLASTIC DISK HAS FOUR UM IT'S FOUR PAPER CLIPS IT FOR THE UP FOR THE PLASTIC DISK STILL IS TWO PAPER IS TWO GRAM PIECES AND YEAH SO PRETTY DO MUCH DOESN'T CHANGE <BREATH>
UM YOU WOULD GET UM MORE PREC- EVEN GRAMS ARE A UNIT OF ACTUAL MEASUREMENT AND SO IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER THAN PUTTING A PAPER CLIP
IT'S SHOWING YOU HOW MANY GRAM BLOCKS ARE COMPARED TO BIGGER GRAM BLOCKS TWENTY IS TWO IS TWENTY ONE GRAMS FOUR FIVES AND TEN TEN IS ONE IS TWO FIVES AND TEN GRAMS AND SO ON
GOODBYE
UM THE STANDARD MEASUREMENT AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS
OH IT'S A IT'S ONE THOUSAND GRAMS <BREATH>
FOR HEAVIER THINGS <BREATH>
THE GRAVEL WAS A HUNDRED GRAMS AND THERE WAS ONLY TWENTY FORTY SIXTY EIGHTY THERE WAS A HUNDRED GRAMS IN THIS BUT IT WAS STILL HEAVIER I I JUST DON'T GET IT
YOU COULD SAY UH OKAY YOU NEED TEN GRAMS WORTH OF NICKELS I'LL GIVE YOU TWO NICKELS AND YOU CAN ALSO REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE THE NICKEL IS WORTH FIVE CENTS AND FIVE GRAMS YEAH <BREATH>
UM THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS IN THERE AND THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAMS IN THERE
UM SO YOU KNOW HOW MANY GRAMS SOMETHING IS
HELLO
<BREATH> UM YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR CALCULATIONS YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT THAT IS ONE HUNDRED GRAMS <BREATH>
O EVERYBODY WILL GET THE SAME MEASUREMENT
UM I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
<BREATH> THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH GRAM PIECES
WE GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS UH WE GOT DIFFERENT RESULTS AND WE SAID THE RESULT AND THEY SAID AND OTHER GROUPS DIDN'T HAVE THAT RESULT THEY WOULD SAY HUH IT'S KIND A FUNNY
ONE PAPER CLIP EQUALS ONE GRAM BLOCK
IT'S USING A BALANCE
UM MEASUREMENTS MORE ACCURATELY THAN YEAH
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING THE STANDARD SYSTEM AND OTHER S UM SYSTEMS
THAT THE PAPER CLIPS ARE ABOUT THE WEIGHT OF A GRAM AND THAT THE ME THE UM PLASTIC DISK IS FOUR GRAMS
TWO GROUPS OF PAPER CLIPS ONE SMALL PAPER CLIP AND ONE BIG PAPER CLIP
<BREATH> WE UM I COMPARING MASS WE DO MASS
THAT UM THE PLASTIC DISK IS MUCH LIGHTER THAN UM THE UM YOU KNOW THE UM I MEAN THE PLASTIC DISK IS MUCH LIGHTER THAN THE WASHER
IT HELPED ME ORDER THEM CAUSE UM I HAD SOME IDEA OF HOW HEAVY THEY WERE LIKE THE WASHER AND THE PLASTIC DISK THE WASHER'S MUCH HEAVIER SO MY HAND WAS GOING DOWN AS FOR THE PLASTIC IT WAS GOING IT STAYED AND SAME WITH THE WOOD
IF UM YOU HAD A PLASTIC IF YOU DID THIS AT HOME AND THEN SHE GAVE YOU THESE MATERIALS THEN YOU COULD FIGURE IT OUT PRETTY EASILY
A ONE GRAM PIECE
UM THE PLASTIC UM IS PRETTY LIGHT CAUSE PLASTIC IS RE USUALLY PRETTY LIGHT UM WOOD IS SOMETIMES PRETTY UM HEAVY BUT SOMETIMES IT'S NOT SO YEAH
COMPARES TWO OBJECTS SAY IF YOU WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE PA HOW MANY PLA PAPER CLIPS WOULD BE HEAVIER THAN THAT THEN YOU COULD USE THIS TOO YOU WANTED TO KNOW IF A PAPER CLIP IS HEAVIER THAN UM A PLASTIC DISK THEN YOU COULD DO THAT
BLOCKS WE USED GRAM BLOCKS <BREATH>
HAS THE SAME SIZE PAPER CLIPS
EVERYBODY WILL GET THE SAME ANSWER UNLESS THE OBJECTS ARE DIFFERENT SIZES OR WEIGHTS
EIGHT GRAMS EQUALS ONE METAL DISK
UM WE CAN MES- WE COULD PUT LIKE A CRACKER ONE AND THEN ONE GRAM TWO GRAM THREE GRAM FOUR GRAM AND FIVE GRAM SO YOU ENDED AT SIX GRAMS AND THAT'S HOW MUCH YOUR CRACKER WEIGHS
GROUPS GROUP ONE'S ANSWERS ARE T UM WAY UM MORE THAN GROUP TWO BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY HAD THE SMALLER PAPER CLIPS AND GROUP TWO HAD THE JUMBOS
IT'LL BE UM IT'LL BE LIKE RIGHT
<BREATH> YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE MADE OF LIKE THE METAL'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE HEAVIEST
IF I USED A BIG ONE AND MAX USED THE SMALL ONE I AND SAY HE GOT ONE PAPER CLIP I'D PROBABLY GET I GOT ONE PAPER T CLIP HE COULD GET TWO OR THREE
UM IT'S DROPPING <BREATH> THEM INTO IT AND THE WASHER'S MUCH MUCH HEAVIER
<BREATH> I IF YOU PUT THE ON THE SAME IT'S GONNA NOT MEASURE HOW MUCH THEY ARE YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM ON DIFFERENT SO YOU KNOW HOW HEAVY THEY ARE
THE PAPER CLIPS WEIGH EXACTLY WHAT THE METAL DISK DOES FOUR PAPER CLIPS I MEAN UH PLASTIC DISKS
THE MORE UM GRAMS THAT GO IN THE HIGHER THE OTHER SIDE GETS THE LOWER THE OTHER SIDE GETS AND THE HIGHER THE ONE WITH THE METAL DISK GETS
THEY'RE THE SCRAM PE- GRAM UM
YOU WOULD GET COMPLETELY DIFFERENT RESULTS
REALLY GOOD
WELL IF YOU KNEW THAT THE WASHER WAS TEN OUNCES THEN WITH AND THE PLASTIC DISK WAS ONE OUNCE AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THAT THE WASHER WAS MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH
<BREATH> UM LIKE UM IT YOU CAN USE YOUR HANDS LIKE WEIGHTS IF YOU HAVE A
S IT'S REALLY HARD TO EXPLAIN <BREATH>
WE USED THE PAPER CLIPS LIKE WE USED MY TABLE GROUP USED THE SMALL ONES AND THEN WE WOULD WEIGH THOSE WE WOULD PUT ONE IN THE PLASTIC DISK AND IT WAS STILL THEN BOOM ONE MORE BOOM ONE MORE AND THAT WAS IT
WELL YOU COULD WEIGH THEM WITH YOUR HAND OR ANYWHERE
UM AT FIRST WE USED OUR HANDS TO MEASURE WELL MY TABLE GROUP USED THEIR HANDS TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT AND WE WOULD SAY WOW THIS IS MUCH HEAVIER AND OH THE PLASTIC DISK IS HEAVIER THAN THE WOOD TILE
THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZES
UM GRAMS UM O
WELL YOU CAN MAKE IT GO FAST AND FUN BUT WHENEVER IT'S NOT PUT TOGETHER WELL WHENEVER IT IS PUT TOGETHER YOU CAN MAKE IT GO REALLY FAST AND COOL AND IT'S SO MUCH FUN PLAYING WITH IT EXCEPT THEN WHENEVER YOU DON'T WHENEVER YOU DON'T PUT IT TO CORRECTLY TOGETHER IT'S LIKE IT JUST COLLAPSED NOTHING REALLY WORKS AS WELL
WELL WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THE PROPELLER THING WOULD SPIN IT UP AND MAKE IT ALL TWIRLY AND SPINNY AND THEN THE PLANE WOULD JUST LIKE SPIN
THE PROPELLER MOVES MAINLY WHENEVER YOU GO BACK AND FORTH WHENEVER THE WIND PUSHES AGAINST THEM BASICALLY JUST CHOPS THE WIND AND IT WOULD TURN UP THE RUBBER BAND
YEAH IT DOES THAT BECAUSE WELL IT HELPS THE PROPELLER SPIN AND IT BASICALLY IS ONE OF THE THINGS WELL THE PROPELLER MAKES THE PLANE MOVE AND THE THING THAT MOVES THE PROPELLER IS THE RUBBER BAND SO
FINE
<BREATH> WHAT MAKES IT A PLANE SYSTEM IS THAT UM IT'S BASICALLY FLYING LIKE A PLANE BUT IT'S BASICALLY JUST FLYING ON A LITTLE LINE THAT YOU CAN BARELY SEE FROM FAR AWAY AND ANOTHER THING THAT'S SIMILAR TO A PLANE IS THAT THE UM RUBBER BAND IS BASICALLY THE ENGINE CAUSE IT'S THE ONE THAT HELPS TURN THE PROPELLER
WELL THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THE FLIGHT LINE IS THAT OTHERWISE WITHOUT THAT LINE IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T REALLY FLY IT WOULD JUST LIKE STAY ON GROUND AND THE PROPELLER PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN MOVE THAT WELL SO THE LINE'S ACTUALLY PRETTY IMPORTANT AND IT HELPS THE PLANE MOVE ACROSS IT
RUBBER BAND AND IT JUST THE PROPELLER BARELY EVEN SPINNED WHENEVER I SAW THEM
I'VE NOTICED THAT IT'S ON A STRING AND THE WEIRD THING IS SOMETIMES WHENEVER IT'S ON THE STRING IT JUST YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD GO STRAIGHT EXCEPT IT ACTUALLY JUST WHIRLS SORT OF
THE IMPORTANCE ABOUT THE FLI- THE FLIGHT LINE IS THAT
FINE
THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF STRAWS ONE IS SUPER JUMBO AND ONE'S JUST JUMBO THE ONE ON THE TOP THAT'S ACTUALLY ON THE STRING IS THIS JU JUST JUMBO THE ONE'S THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE PLANES ARE SUPER JUMBO AND WE POKED HOLES IN THE SUPER JUMBO BECAUSE WE NEEDED SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE THE PLANE COULD HANG AND IT COULD GO ON THE LINE
THE RUBBER BAND ARE MAINLY USED FOR UM HOLDING THE PIECES ON AND HELPING IT GO AROUND AND
WE HAVE BEEN GRAPHING WELL WE HAVE BEEN GRAPHING AND DOING MANY THINGS LIKE WE'VE BEEN GRAPHING AND MAKING PLANES
WELL ACTUALLY A PROBLEM THAT SOME GROUPS HAVE BUT I DIDN'T BECAUSE I ACTUALLY READ THE INSTRUCTIONS SOME GROUPS JUST DIDN'T EVEN READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND JUST WENT ON AND DID IT AND THEY FORGOT ABOUT
WE HAVE BEEN DOING STUFF LIKE MAKING PENDULUMS AND HOW THEY SWING
YEAH O
WELL THE X AXIS IS THE PENDULUM'S LENGTH <BREATH> SO WHENEVER YOU DO THE LENGTH YOU WOULD LINE IT UP WITH THE NUMBER OF SWINGS LIKE SAY YOU DID TWELVE LIKE TWELVE IS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT ABOUT SO THIRTY EIGHT SQUARE FEET OR INCHES WOULD BE TWELVE SWINGS
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PREDICATION IS WRONG OR RIGHT YOU CAN SWING IT NORMALLY FROM THE SURFACE THAT IT'S ON OR LIKE THE DESK OR THE CEILING OR SOMETHING <BREATH> BUT ANOTHER THING IS THAT MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T COUNT LIKE EVERY TIME IT SWINGS JUST LIKE COUNT TWO SECONDS AND THEN THAT'S ONE
ONE LINE IS CALLED THE Y THE ONE'S THAT'S LIKE STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN AND THE OTHER LINE THAT'S LIKE ACROSS IS CALLED THE X
THE TYPE OF THINGS THAT WE PUT ON THE Y AXIS ARE THE NUMBER OF SWINGS SO LIKE WHENEVER THEY'RE LIKE YOU WOULD PUT IT THERE AND THEN CROSS OVER TO THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM TO SEE HOW LONG OF SWINGS AND THE NUMBER OF SWINGS FOR THAT AMOUNT OF LONGNESS
THE KIND OF INFORMATION WE PUT ON THE X AXIS IS HOW LONG THE PENDULUM IS LIKE IF BUT THE THING IS YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUT IT BETWEEN IF IT WAS FORTY SOMETHING LIKE BETWEEN FORTY AND FIFTY
THERE ARE POSITIONED IN L FORM BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN TELL WHENEVER THE LINES CROSS WHENEVER THE LINES CROSS IT WILL MEAN LIKE HOW MANY NUMBERS OF SWINGS IN THE PENDULUM'S LENGTH
THE PENDULUM LENGTH ON THE X ASIK- AXIS IS WHEN YOU PUT WELL YOU DON'T ACTUALLY REALLY PUT THE STRING ON THERE BUT YOU TAKE WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE ON A PIECE OF PAPER OR SOMETHING ON TO THE PENDULUM PENDULUM LENGTH OF WELL THE X AXIS
THE GRAPH IS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IT HAS AND HOW LONG THE PENDULUM IS
THE KIND OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN USE ARE
<BREATH> YOU USE YOUR GRAPH FOR PREDICTING YOU CAN PREDICT THE NUMBER OF SWINGS OR YOU COULD PREDICT HOW MANY SWINGS FOR HOW MANY FOR HOW MANY INCHES OR SQUARE FEET <BREATH> THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM IS
YEAH REALLY
M SLASH X AXIS YOU COULD PUT LIKE HOW LONG IT IS OR HOW SHORT IT IS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WITH THE PENDULUM OR HOW MANY DID IT ALREADY SWING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHENEVER IT SWINGS WHENEVER IT GETS LONGER IT HAS MORE TO SWING ON SO WHENEVER IT GETS LONGER IT HAS MORE TO SWING SO IT SWINGS SLOWER SO LIKE
FINE
JUST KEEPS ON GOING FARTHER
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE VARIABLES THAT WE WOULD CHANGE AND I ACTUALLY PREDICTED THAT IT WOULD GO FARTHER AND THE PERSON THAT I WAS WORKING WITH SHE THOUGHT IT THAT IT WAS GOING TO GO LIKE NOT AS FAR IT'S LIKE LESS EXCEPT THEN IT ACTUALLY WENT FAR
DOING LIKE SAY THE ANGLE IS TWENTY YOU COULD CHANGE IT TO LIKE THIRTY OR FORTY OR SOMETHING
IT WAS ABOUT SEEING HOW FAR THE FLIPPER OR THE CORK WOULD GO
I THOUGHT OF
IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THAT IS
WELL YOU MIGHT GET IT TO GO UP UM WHAT I NOTICED IN MOST OF OUR EXPERIMENTS THAT AS LIKE ANGLE ON THIRTY THEN FORTY THEN FIFTY UM MOST OF OUR EXPERIMENTS THE DISTANCE WOULD GO FARTHER UP WITH IT
WELL IF YOU DO THAT WHEN WELL SAY YOU DID IT AND THEN YOU FORGOT ABOUT THAT YOU COULD JUST DO IT AGAIN AND OR MAY BE YOU MIGHT GET DIFFERENT DATA LET'S SAY YOU MESSED UP ON A FEW OF THEM YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO IT ANOTHER TIME THE NEXT DAY MESSED UP WITH
CHANGING ONE MORE VARIABLE VARIABLE IS ABOUT LIKE IF YOU ARE WONDERING SOMETHING YOU'D CHANGE ONLY ONE THOUGH BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGED TWO THEN YOU'D SKIP A LOT OF DATA
WELL THERE'S A FLIPPER BOARD YOU KNOW LIKE A LITTLE FLIPPER BOX WITH A SLIT IN IT SO THEN YOU WOULD EITHER PUSH IT IN ALL THE WAY OR PULL IT OUT SOME JUST TO MEASURE IT
WELL THE CONTROLLED THINGS IN MY EXPERIMENT ARE
HI MARNIE
WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT CHANGING ONE VARIABLE IN A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IS YOU MISS A LOT OF DATA IF YOU CHANGE LIKE SAY I CHANGED TWO THINGS LIKE THE LENGTH OF THE STICK AND UH LIKE THE LENGTH OF THE FLIPPER AND AND THE ANGLE THEN YOU'RE MISSING HOW IF YOU CHANGE THE LENGTH OF
FINE
WELL WHAT MADE IT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT IS WELL SINCE WE'VE CHANGED THE HEIGHT UM IT TURNED OUT THAT YOU COULD CONTROL HOW FAR IT WENT AND HOW HIGH IF YOU CHANGE THAT
WE WANTED TO TEST HOW FAR THE CORK WOULD GO LIKE IF THEY'RE FLAT ON THE GROUND OR UM AT AN ANGLE
I SEE THE ANGLE IS TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY AND
YOU WOULD WANT TO LIKE NOT REALLY CHANGE THAT MUCH LIKE YOU WOULD JUST WANT TO KEEP ON BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL GO THROUGH THE WHOLE TEST AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S
YEAH
SAY IF I HAD <BREATH> TWENTY EXCEPT THEN IF YOU COUNTED BY ONES YOU WOULD PROBABLY ONLY GO UP TO TEN SO I WOULD COUNT BY TENS SO THEN YOU WOULD GET TO TWENTY AND THEN EIGHTEEN OR WHATEVER YOU HAVE
<BREATH> WELL MAINLY THE DATA THAT WE GRAPH ON I'VE NOTICED THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE ADD ON OR SOMETHING WOULD ALWAYS MAKE IT GO LOWER IN WEIGHT SO EXCEPT MAYBE IF WE ADDED A MOTOR IT WOULD GO FASTER ONLY BECAUSE THERE'S
<BREATH> THE INFORMATION I FIND THERE IS THAT X IS MOTORS OF WELL OF THE MOTORS THAT LIKE THE RUBBER BANDS AND THE Y IS HOW FAR THE PLANE WENT WITH THOSE MOTORS
<BREATH> INCREMENTAL CHANGE IS MAINLY ABOUT LIKE CHANGING THE VARIABLES ON THE THING THAT YOU'RE MAKING LIKE SAY YOU'RE MAKING A PLANE AND THEY CHANGE THE WEIGHT BY ADDING A PAPER CLIP OR BY ADDING A ROCK OR SOMETHING
THOUGH <BREATH>
MAINLY TYPICAL IN
WE GRAPHED THEM WELL WE GRAPHED THEM BECAUSE TO SEE HOW THE PLANE WENT LIKE SAY IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE MOTOR OR SOMETHING THEN IT MIGHT GO UP OR DOWN WE DON'T KNOW JUST THINKING ABOUT IT BUT WE KNOW SEEING IT ON A GRAPH
HI <BREATH>
WELL WHAT HAPPENS TO IT IS LIKE SAY THERE IS ONE MOTOR AND IT WAS ON EIGHTY THEN THEN IT WOULD BE JUST BE LIKE
<BREATH> MAINLY THE X LIKE THE X LINE <BREATH> IT IS THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS AND THE Y IS THE <BREATH> UM HOW MANY HOW FAR IT THE PLANE WENT
WELL IF I WAS GRAPHING THE THINGS ON THE Y AXIS I WOULD
<BREATH> I NOTICE THAT THEY GO UP BY ONES AND THAT THAT ALSO TELLS ME THAT IT THE HIGHEST THAT IT WOULD BE ABLE TO GO ON IS TEN
THE NUMBER OF WINDS CHANGES BY TEN AND THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS IS JUST LIKE ONE SO IF YOU DO IT BY TENS I WOULD THINK THAT YOU FOR THE DISTANCE YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING IN BETWEEN THE NUMBERS
<BREATH> WELL MAINLY WHAT HAPPENS IS EVEN THOUGH THE MOTOR WOULD MAKE IT GAIN WEIGHT AND MAKE YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD SLOW DOWN BUT THE MOTOR ACTUALLY LIKE SPINS OR WHATEVER IT DOES MAKES IT GO FASTER
WELL THE AXIS GOES UP BY ONE AND WHENEVER YOU SAY I ADDED ONE PASSENGER AND THEN IT HAD ONE THING BUT WHENEVER YOU'RE MAKING A GRAPH YOU ALSO HAVE TO TAKE A NOTE IF I'M COUNTING BY ONES IT'S TWO HUNDRED HOW AM I GOING TO GET TO TWO HUNDRED SO YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT
<BREATH> WELL IN PASSENGERS MAYBE I CAN SEE THAT FOUR AND LIKE THREE QUARTERS WOULD BE <BREATH> LIKE THE MOST AMOUNT ON THE LINE THAT IT WOULD GO BUT THEN IT WOULD GO FARTHER DOWN AS THE PASSENGERS WENT DOWN
<BREATH> SOME DEPENDENT THINGS ARE THAT WELL YOU HAVE SQUARES TO HELP YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS LIKE WHERE TO PUT THE DOTS AND HOW IT OCCU- UM HOW TO CONNECT THEM
YEP
<BREATH> THE LINE MIGHT TELL YOU ABOUT THE VARIABLES THAT WHENEVER YOU ADD THEM IT GETS HEAVIER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN IT WOULD JUST GO DOWN FROM EIGHT HUNDRED TO LIKE ZERO
MATION THAT'S PUT ON A GRAPH IS LIKE IF YOU TESTED SOMETHING OR FOR US LIKE THE PLANES THE BOTTOM WE WOULD MEET UP WHERE THE LINES WOULD MEET FOR LIKE SAY FOUR PASSENGERS WITH SEVEN WE WOULD MEET WHERE THE LINES MEET
THIS GRAPH IS <BREATH> ABOUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT MAINLY THE PLANES THAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING IN SCIENCE
THE INCREMENTS IN THIS DATA ARE LIKE THE VARIABLES OF THE WINDS AND THE NUMBERS THAT THE VARIABLES OF THE WINDS ARE THE NUMBER OF THE PASSENGERS
FINE
I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT PENDULUMS HOW THEY SWING AND HOW THEY WOULD CHANGE IF YOU CHANGE SOMETHING
NORMALLY YOU CHANGE THEM LIKE ONE AT A TIME AND THEN AFTER THAT YOU CAN CHANGE NORMALLY YOU JUST CHANGE IT ONE AT A TIME
BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE MORE THAN ONE THING AT A TIME THEN IT WOULD BE WELL YOU WON'T TO BE GETTING THROUGH EVERY EXPERIMENT YOU WILL JUST BE GETTING LIKE SKIPPING THROUGH SOME
YOU CAN CHANGE MANY THINGS WE CAN CHANGE LIKE THE LENGTH OF THE STRING TO LIKE WE NORMALLY STARTED OUT LIKE THIRTY SIX INCHES
<BREATH> I THINK IT WAS MAINLY ABOUT LIKE SHORTEN THE STRING AND MADE THE BOBS HEAVIER
WELL I THINK THE SMALLER THE SWINGS FASTER BECAUSE THERE'S LIKE INAUDIBLE
FINE
THEY WERE MAINLY ABOUT LIKE HOW YOU WOULD CHANGE THEM TO MAKE THEM SWING FASTER OR SLOWER AND STUFF LIKE THAT
I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT PENDULUMS AND
IT TELLS ME THAT THERE IS HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT IN THIS SOIL
I THINK THAT THE DELTA MOUNTAIN AND FARM LANDS HAVE MORE ORGANIC CARBON
THERE IS A LOT OF THE PROPERTIES OF SOIL IN THAT THEN CAUSE IT HAS SILT CLAY HUMMUS GRAVEL AND THAT STUFF
I DON'T THINK SOILS ARE ALL THE SAME CAUSE IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE OTHER THING THAT YOU SHOWED ME THERE SEEMED TO BE A LOT OF DIFFERENT MATERIAL
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MATERIALS
THERE'S HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT IN IT
THEY SAID THAT THERE WERE THERE'S THOSE THINGS IN SOIL THERE'S THOSE THINGS IN SOIL
SOIL PROJECTS
HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT SILT SILT SILT
THINK THEY COME FROM MORE SANDY PLACES LIKE THE DESERT HAS SOME SAND AT THE TOP BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT WAS FOUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT CAUSE IF IT WAS IT'D PROBABLY BE ALL SAND AND STUFF AND THEN THE DELTA SEEMS TO HAVE LOTS OF SAND BUT THE THE MOUNTAINS HAVE A TINY BIT OF SAND BUT FARM LANDS IS MOSTLY JUST REGULAR SOIL SO STUFF
HUMUS CLAY AND STUFF
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
I NOTICE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF PLANT LIFE LIKE CACTI AND CACTI AND BUSHES AND MORE CACTI
MY WIFE JUST DIED AGAIN
(())
GOOD BYE
DELTA HAS A LOT MORE SAND THAN DESERT
IT WAS CALLED SOIL
IT'S MADE OF LOTS OF THINGS DEPENDING ON THE AREA
CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
DELTA HAS VERY SMALL GRAINS IN THE MIDDLE WHILE DESERT HAS MORE HAS BIGGER GRAINS THAN MOUNTAINS HAVE BIGGER GRAINS AND FARM LANDS HAS PRETTY SMALL GRAINS JUST NOT LIKE SUPER BIG OR SUPER TINY KIND OF NORMAL GRAINS
THE FARM LAND SEEMS TO HAVE A LOT OF HAY STUFF ON THE TOP AND TOP GRAVEL STUFF
HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
DELTA HAS SOME VERY VERY NICE SAND IN THE MIDDLE
<SIDE_SPEECH>
THEY BOTH HAVE A GOOD REALLY FINE LAYER OF NICE WHITE SAND ON TOP BUT DESERT HAS A LITTLE LESS OF THAT AND IT DOESN'T HAVE AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S IN WATER IT DOESN'T HAVE THE LITTLE LITTLE BITS AND STUFF FLOATING UP WHEN DELTA DOES HAVE LITTLE BITS AND STUFF AND DELTA ONLY HAS A TINY BIT OF THOSE WEIRD OF BIG GRAINS AT THE BOTTOM BUT DESERT HAS A TONE OF BIG GRAINS
ALL THE OTHER KIDS WITH THE PUMPED UP KICK
HUMUS GRAVEL CLAY AND SILT
NO
I NOTICE THAT THE WATER DISAPPEARS
(())
THE SAND AND WATER MADE THE WATER ALL LIKE MISTY AND BROWN WHEN THE SALT AND WATER WELL THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO IT AND KEPT ITS COLOR
IT'S A MIXTURE
I DON'T KNOW
PLEASE REPEAT THAT
IT'S A MIXTURE
(())
IT DISSOLVES INTO IT
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN YOU GOT THE SOLUTE
CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
IF THE MASS DOESN'T GO
IT'S PLAYING ONE OF THE MIXTURE
CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
IT'S IT'S CONSIDERED A SOLUTION
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
THAT EVEN THOUGH THE SALT DISSOLVED IT STILL ADDS ITS WEIGHT
YES
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FLOOD
CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
IT'S A SOLUTION
IT'S BEING IT'S MULTIPLY IT'S BEING (())
THINK IT'S TRYING TO MAKE THE COLOR CHANGE AND HOW IT MIXES IN AND YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE IT AS SOLID ANYMORE
TIME LOTS AND LOTS OF TIME
IT'S A SOLUTION I THINK THAT IT'S A SOLUTION
CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
CAUSE THE WATER'S LIKE FLOATING UP INTO THE AIR AND THEN THE STUFF IS LIKE STAYING ON THE BOTTOM
BY DRYING OUT THE WATER SO THERE'S NO MUCH WATER LEFT WHICH I FORGOT THE WORD FOR
I FORGOT THE WORD FOR IT
IT'S A MIXTURE
WELL THEN THE SOLUTE IS TURNED INTO CRYSTALS AND THEN YOU GOT IT OUT
OKAY
THE SALT WILL JUST BLENDED INTO THE WATER SO IF YOU DRINK IT IT'S SALTY WATER IT DIDN'T LIKE DISAPPEAR INTO AN ENDLESS VOID IT MORE JUST (()) INTO WATER FORM
IT'S A SOLUTION
I FORGOT THE WORD
I FORGOT THE WORD FOR IT
IT TELLS ME THAT THE MORE THAT THE WEIGHT THAT YOU ADD IN ADDS TO THE WEIGHT SO IT ADDS TO A TOTAL OF SIXTY FIVE CAUSE FIFTY PLUS FIFTEEN EQUALS SIXTY FIVE SO THAT THAT MEANS THAT IT'S SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
THAT NO WEIGHT IS ADDED THAT NO WEIGHT IS LOST WHEN YOU ADD IN THAT NO WEIGHT TO THE SALT IS LOST WHEN YOU PUT IN WATER
IT'S A SOLUTION
THE SOLUTION WELL THE SALT MORE DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER MAKING SALTY WATER WHEN THE MIXTURES JUST KIND OF LIKE MIX IN BUT YOU CAN STILL SEE THE TWO DIFFERENCES WITH SALT YOU CAN'T REALLY THERE'S ONLY SMALL AMOUNTS OF DIFFERENCES AND
TWENTY GRAMS PLUS TWENTY GRAMS EQUALS FORTY GRAMS AND THEN TEN GRAMS PLUS FORTY GRAMS EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS SO THAT EQUALS UP TO THE FIFTY GRAMS IF YOU COMBINE THEM ALL TOGETHER SO ON THE RIGHT WHEN WITH THE EQUAL SIDE IT SHOWS ALL THE (()) UP TOGETHER EQUALS FIFTY GRAMS
IN A MIXTURE
THE SALT (())
THE MASS OF THE SALT
ALL OF THE FOOD DIFFERENT FOOD MATERIAL STUFF IS SEPARATING INTO PILES
MIXTURES IS WHAT YOU MIX SOMETHING SOLUTIONS IS WHEN YOU GET SOMETHING
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOUR FOOD IS MOVING BUT THE SECOND IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THEY'RE ALL IN LITTLE COLONIES
THE SALT IS BECOME VERY SMALL AND WELL IF YOU SEE THE WATER RISES A LITTLE BIT WHEN YOU PUT THE SALT IN
MOTHER WAS A TYPE WRITER AND YOUR DAD WAS A SMART PHONE
WIFE JUST DIED
THEY'RE SEPARATING
BE BAD
YOU'RE SCARY
BECAUSE THERE ARE LITTLE ANIMALS IN YOUR FOOD
WELL BECAUSE THE WATER HAS ALREADY DISSOLVED INTO THE THE GRAPE MIX HAS ALREADY DISSOLVED INTO THE THE WATER SO HI GAGE
THE WATER IS FILTERING
MARBLES TRAIL MIX SALAD WATER AND SOME WOOD CHIPS AND PAPER CLIPS I SEE THAT THE MARBLES ARE IN WATER AND THEY'RE ALL IN CUPS EXCEPT FOR THE SALAD AND TRAIL MIX AND THAT THE SALAD TASTES MUCH BETTER THAN THE TRAIL MIX
THE SALT WILL GET DISSOLVED AND THE WATER WILL GET BIGGER
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WATER WAS FILTERED AND THE SAND STAYED IN THE COFFEE FILTER
WATER IS FILTERING
SALT WE CALL THE SOLID MATERIAL SALT
A SOLUTION
I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO THEY DO HAVE TO
THE IT'S THE WATER IS BEING FILTERED THEY PUT A FILTER IN THE BOWL AND POURED THE WATER THROUGH AND LEFT THE MARBLES ON THE OUTSIDE
(()) THE SALT DISSOLVED
MIXTURES
MIXTURES DID NOT CHANGE BUT THE FILTERS DID BECAUSE THE MIXTURES USED BE SAND AND WATER BUT NOW IT'S AND BUT NOW THE WATER'S DOWN TO THE BOTTOM CAUSE WE USED A COFFEE FILTER INSTEAD OF A REGULAR FILTER A SCREEN FILTER
WE KNOW THAT IT CAN BE SEPARATED IF WE JUST EVAPORATE THE WATER
SALAD IS MUCH BETTER THAN TRAIL MIX
THE THE PILE ON THE LEFT IS ALL MIXED IN BUT THE PILE ON THE RIGHT IS VERY ORGANIZED IT GOES M AND MS CASHEWS AND RAISINS
THEY'RE ALL IN LITTLE THEY'RE ALL IN LITTLE THING
YEAH SOME OF THEM ARE SOLID MORE SOLID THAN OTHERS
SALT
WATER IS GOING INTO THE BOWL BUT THE MARBLES ARE STAYING ON TOP ON THE FILTER
<SILENCE>
FILTERED WATER
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE TEN NINE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UM IT'S A BALANCE
TESTING TESTING <LAUGH>
OKAY
WELL OVER
<BREATH> OH YEAH SIXTEEN UM WAIT THAT'S OUNCES SIXTEEN OUNCES IS A POUND
UM THE WATER IS FILLING UP THE POCKETS
UNTIL AND THEN WHEN IT GETS LEVEL THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN TO STOP THEN YOU COUNT HOW MANY GRAMS WERE IN THE OTHER CUP AND THAT'S HOW MANY GRAMS IT WEIGHS
LEVEL MEANS THAT UM THIS LITTLE BAR IS LINED UP WITH THIS THINGIE
AN EMPTY WATER BOTTLE OR SOMETHING
THAT'S GOOD
WELL WE TOOK UM WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH WATER A SPONGE COULD HOLD
UM THE WATER IN THE SPONGE
MAYBE ONE OR TWO
MORE DEFINITELY MORE <BREATH> BECAUSE IT HAS WATER IN IT
WELL
WHAT'S UP WITH THE SODA CAN
THAT'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS WE CAN GET
OH TODAY
THE WET THE WET SPONGE DR UM WEIGHS MORE CAUSE THERE'S MORE STUFF ADDED TO IT LIKE LIQUID SO IT'S A LOT HEAVIER
MMM HMM NOPE PUT ANOTHER GRAM THAT'S GOOD
WELL HMM <BREATH>
<BREATH> UM WE WE GET A R DRY SPONGE AND THEN WE PUT IT IN ONE OF THE PLASTIC CUPS AND THEN WE MEASURE IT BY GRAMS
THE KILOGRAM IS ONE THOUSAND GRAMS
MEASURING WITH GRAMS HOW CAN I PUT THAT <BREATH> WELL Y THEY'RE GRAMS ARE LIKE THIS BIG <BREATH> AND UM YOU PUT THEM IN THE OTHER CUP ONE BY ONE <BREATH> SO
<BREATH> BECAU- IF IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY HEAVY YOU WOULD USE A KILOGRAM
WE FILL IT UP WE FILL THE SPONGE UP WITH WATER LET IT DRIP ALL THE EXTRA WATER OUT AND THEN PUT THE WET SPONGE IN THE OTHER C IN THE CUP <BREATH>
SIX GRAMS
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SIXTEEN GRAMS BUT THE <BREATH> HOW MUCH WATER WE CAN HOLD IN THE SPONGE IS THIRTEEN CAUSE WE SUBTRACTED THREE FROM THE DRY SPONGE
<BREATH> UM IT THE F THE FIVE GRAMS TURNED INTO A FIVE BLOCK
THEY'RE NOT AS HEAVY BUT IF YOU PUT LIKE A KILOGRAM WHICH IS LIKE ONE THOUSAND GRAMS THEN YOU COULD MEASURE BY KILA UM MEASURE WEIGHT WITH KILOGRAMS MAYBE
IF YOU PUT LIKE FIVE IN AT ONCE MAYBE IT'S TOO HEAVY UNLESS IT'S LIKE A HEAVY ITEM LIKE SAY HMM
WELL <BREATH> FIRST WE MEASURED THE DRY SPONGE SO THAT WE KNEW HOW MUCH TO UM TO SUBTRACT AND THEN AND FROM THE WET SPONGE AND THEN WE TOOK THE WET SPONGE AND PUT IT IN AND THEN IT WAS LIKE TEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WE WOULD SUBTRACT LIKE TWO OR HOW MUCH THE DRY SPONGE WAS
MAYBE LAPTOP COMPUTER A BAG
MMM I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER
NO MAYBE ONE MORE
<BREATH> THREE GRAMS
NO NOT REALLY
N MMM
IT WENT WELL <BREATH> BUT SOME OF OUR SPONGES WERE DIFFERENT UM SIZES BECAUSE THEY WERE CUT OUT FROM A BIGGER SPONGE SO WE DIDN'T ALL GET THE SAME ANSWER
<BREATH> UM IF THERE WAS ANY EXTRA WATER WE WOULD SUCK IT UP WITH THE UM SYRINGE AND THEN PUSH IT INTO THE GRADUATED CYLINDER INSTEAD OF INTO THE UM INTO THE CONTAINER AND TH AND THEY BOTH HELD THE SAME THING BUT THE GRADUATED CYLINDER WAS A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO TELL SO
OH YEAH
WELL UM THE GRADUATED CYLINDER UM COUNTS LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX UM MILLILITERS THE CONTAINER JUST HOLDS THE WATER
<BREATH> WE WOULD UM CALCULATE IT ON A STICKY NOTE WE'D DO LIKE FIFTY ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HUNDRED STUFF LIKE THAT
THIS UM OUR CONTAINER DIDN'T HAVE LIKE ONE HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED STUFF LIKE THAT
UM USING SOMETHING MORE SCIENTIFIC LIKE UM
OH YEAH MILLILITERS AND UM WE FIGURED OUT THAT THERE WAS UM ONE HUNDRED AND WELL WAIT TWO HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE UM MILLILITERS AND THEN WE FILLED IT UP TO A SO IT WASN'T THAT MUCH AND UM WE GOT FIFTY THREE THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT SO
THEN MY DAD FLEW ME HOME HE HA HE USED TO HAVE A JOB IN CALIFORNIA
IT COU E YOU SUCKED UP THE WATER AND THEN YOU S YEAH IN A SYRINGE AND WE HAD A SMALL CUP AND WE TOOK THE WA AND WE FILLED FILLED IT UP TO THE LETTER D IT SAID A B C D AND FILLED IT UP A B C D E <BREATH> AND WE FILLED IT UP TO D AND UM WE WE TOOK THE SYRINGE AND PULLED WA PULLED WATER UP AND THAT WAS UM FIFTY FIFTY UM
WELL YEAH WHAT YOU SAID WAS WHAT HAPPENED I JUST CAN'T REPEAT IT ALL <LAUGH>
OUR THE THE OTHER OUR OTHER SCIENCE LESSON WE HAD ABOUT WATER WAS UM I THINK LAST YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT UM AND WE TOOK THE GRADUATED CYLINDER INSTEAD OF THE SYRINGE AND WE PUT IT INTO THE UM CONTAINER INSTEAD
UM WELL THEN WE HAD THE I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS CALLED
UH-HUH YEAH
UM WE WE HAD TO PULL IT UP TO FIFTY MILLILITERS AND THEN W WITH THE EXTRA WATER WE WOULD SQUIRT IT INTO THE UM GRADUATED CYLINDER AND THEN IT WE GOT IT UP TO FIVE SO NO WAIT WE GOT IT UP TO TWENTY FIVE <BREATH> SO WE COUNTED THAT TWENTY FIVE WITH OUR TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE
UM WE WE PUT IT INTO THE CONTAINER UNTIL UM THERE WAS NO MORE WATER IN THE CUP AND THEN WE WOULD COUNT LIKE UM THIS SE WE WOULD PULL UP WITH THE SYRINGE AND THEN PUSH INTO THE IN THE CONTAINER AND SAY FIFTY ONE HUNDRED UH-HUH
UM IT WASN'T THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY BUT STILL IT WAS THE BEST YOU COULD GET WITH SCHOOL STUFF
<BREATH> YEAH
WELL I THINK THE WELL THIS ONE COUNTS BY TENS INSTEAD OF FIVES SO IT'S NOT THE MOST IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AS EFFICIENT AS OUR ONE THAT WE WERE WORKING WITH IN CLASS
YEAH IT'S IT SAID LIKE FIVE TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY UP TO FIFTY PRETTY W
<BREATH> NO WE WE HAD TWENTY FIVE IN OUR GRADUATED CYLINDER AND THEN TWO HUNDRED IN THE CONTAINER
YEAH
<BREATH> NO WE HAD
UM <BREATH> WELL
I THINK WE'RE FINISHED
<BREATH> WELL I CAN'T REALLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE <LAUGH>
A SYRINGE THAT UM WOULD WOULD UM LIKE CONNECT TO THE CONNECT IN SO IT WOULD HO IT WOULD LIKE SNAP INTO THE CUP THEN YOU WOULD PULL THE WATER OUT MAYBE YOU WOULD PULL AND YOU WOULD ACCIDENTALLY BE PULLING THE SYRINGE OUT AND YOU WOULDN'T GET AS MUCH WATER SO
NO NOT REALLY NOT SO MUCH
NOT THAT I REMEMBER
<BREATH> OKAY AND WE ALWAYS USE AND WE ALSO USE BODY BENCHMARKS SO IF WE LIKE DON'T HAVE A RULER UM I CAN TELL LIKE WHAT'S AN INCH WHAT'S A FOOT AND WHAT LIKE THAT STUFF LIKE THAT
BUT I GET IT LIKE TWENTY IS TWO TENS TWO TENS EQUALS FOUR FIVES FOUR FIVES EQUALS FORTY WU UM EQUALS TWENTY ONES
I DON'T REALLY KNOW <BREATH>
THERE'S TEN UM MILLIMETERS IN A CENTIMETER
WELL ONE OF THEM IS STRAIGHT UP AND ONE OF THEM IS KINDA WOBBLY SO YOU DON'T MEASURE IT THE CORRECT WAY
<BREATH> THAT YOU CAN MES- THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT THAT YOU CAN MAKE THEM THE SAME BY PUTTING MAYBE SOMETHING LIGHTER BUT YOU CAN USE MORE THAN ONE OF THOSE LIGHTER THINGS
WELL IT'S A MEASURING THING IT MEASURE IT MEASURES WHAT IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER
<BREATH> MILLIMETERS CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER <LAUGH> WHAT THOSE ARE BUT
NO NOT REALLY
<BREATH> UM WE JUST UM MEASURED THINGS WITH METER TAPES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
NO <BREATH>
MEASUREMENT
YEAH OH YEAH I SEE
YEAH
OH YEAH
YEAH
NAH UH
<BREATH> UM S I WOULD SAY SO IF YOU'RE TALKING SOMETHING LIKE THIS THEN YOU CAN MEASURE THE CUP WITH NOTHING AND WITH SOMETHING WITH SOMETHING AND YOU KNOW THAT THE ONE WITH SOMETHING IS GONNA BE UM LOWER BECAUSE IT'S HEAVIER
WIDER THAN TABLE THAN TABLES ARE HIGH
NO
<BREATH> WELL UM DOORS ARE UM CAN BE
METERS SO THERE'S ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETERS IN A METER RIGHT
<BREATH> IF WE *USE* WELL IT'S NOT VERY EFFICIENT TO USE PACES AND BIG STEPS THAN USING MEASURING ITEMS
THIS LOOKS LIKE A METER TAPE YEAH
<BREATH> NO NOT REALLY YEAH YOU PUT EM YOU PUT THAT ONE ON TOP OF THAT ONE AND THEN YOU PUT THINGS IN THESE AND THEN YOU BA- TRY TO BALANCE THEM OUT
NO NOT EVERYBODY
YES
<BREATH> UM RULERS
NOPE <BREATH>
<BREATH> BECAUSE IF YOU USE ONE OF YOUR UNITS OF MEASUREMENT YOU C YOUR FRIEND CAN BE LIKE OKAY IT'S ONE METER LONG AND HALF A METER WIDE AND THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY MEASURE THAT WITH SOMETHING MORE EFFICIENT LIKE A METER TAPE
<BREATH> UM LIKE WITH METERS AND CENTIMETERS AND INCHES AND FEET AND STUFF LIKE THAT
<BREATH> SO IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CENTIMETERS AND DECIMETERS DECIMETERS IS TEN CENTIMETERS
LIKE COMPUTERS DOORS BOOKS
WELL <BREATH> MAYBE YOU'RE TAKING A BIG STEP AND THEN YOU TAKE ANOTHER BIG STEP BUT IT'S SMALLER THAN THE OTHER ONE <BREATH> SO SAY YOU HAVE A FRIEND AND HE TAKES AND HE WANTS YOU TO MAKE A BED AND YOU DO AND HE SAYS SO IT'S SO IT'S THREE FEET THREE BIG FEET LONG AND AND ONE BIG FOOT WIDE AND YOU TAKE EM BUT HE DOESN'T BUT HE GETS HIS BED TOO BIG CAUSE YOU WERE A LITTLE BIT OLDER THAN HE IS AND YOU TAKE BIGGER STEPS
<BREATH> I COULD
UM WHEN THE PAPER CLIPS GOT PUT IN TO MEASURE THE SAME AS THE CHIP WE DIDN'T BUT IT WAS THE MOST INTERESTING HERE
WELL IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO BUT I THINK I CAN REMEMBER HOW MANY BIG STEPS IT TOOK
YEAH
BECAUSE MAYBE THEY THEY WERE CUT UNEVENLY
YEAH
YEAH
<BREATH> SO THERE ARE TWO CUPS IN EACH SIDE AND YOU PUT YOUR UH THE ITEM IN ONE SIDE AND THEN YOU PUT THE GRAMS IN THE OTHER SIDE <BREATH> AND YOU PUT IN ONE GRAM AT A TIME AND IF YOU GET UP TO FIVE GRAMS YOU CAN PUT IN A FIVE GRAM PIECE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH
AND THEN YOU TAKE A FIVE AND THEN ANOTHER FIVE AND IF IT'S TOO HEAVY WHEN YOU PUT IN THE N ANOTHER FIVE YOU WOULD TAKE THE FIVE OUT AND PUT IN FOUR LITTLE GRAM PIECES
DRY SPONGE <LAUGH>
GRAMS ARE MEASURING TOOLS
THEN TAKE SOMETHING LIGHTER THAN AN ORANGE
AB AN ESTIMATE IS JUST GUESSING
YEAH
<LAUGH> MAYBE A LITTLE HEAVY
<BREATH> UM THE DRY SPONGE WHEN WE MEASURED IT IT MEASURED ABOUT ONE OR TWO GRAMS CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER <BREATH>
WOW
MMM PROBABLY NOT
IN THE BALANCE AND THEN YOU MEASURE IT OUT WITH THE GRAMS
WELL WHEN YOU HAVE THE WET SPONGE YOU WEIGH IT UNTIL IT'S FULL AND YOU KNOW H THAT IT'S FULL WHEN IT WHEN IT STOPS GETTING BIGGER
AND NOT KILOGRAMS <LAUGH> KILOGRAMS ARE LIKE ONE HUN ONE ON HUNDRED GRAMS OR SOMETHING I CAN'T REMEMBER ONE THOUSAND
NOT VERY HEAVY
SO IF IT'S DRY IT'S NOT GONNA BE VERY BIG WET IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIGGER AND SOAKED IT'S GONNA BE GIGANTIC <LAUGH>
CENTIMETERS
MMM HMM PROBABLY
MILLIGRA- I THINK THERE'S THESE THINGS CALLED MILLIGRAMS I CAN'T REMEMBER BUT THEY'RE SOMETHING BIGGER THAN A KILOGRAM OH YEAH
ONE HUNDRED
BECAUSE IT MAY BE TOO MUCH
TEXAS FROM HERE <LAUGH> MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WELL IF
NO NOT MUCH
HI
THE BIGGER S THE BIG SPONGE WOULD HOLD MORE WATER AND IT WOULD WEIGH MORE WHEN IT'S DRY
NO
YEAH
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THESE LITTLE HOLES AND THEY'RE SQUISHY SO YOU PUT EM IN THE WATER AND THEY ABSORB THE WATER AND AND THEN THEY GET BIGGER AND THEN AND THEN YOU AND THEN YOU SQUEEZE THE WATER WELL WHEN YOU'RE MEASURING IT YOU SQUEEZE YOU PUT YOU PUT THE DRY SPONGE IN FIRST AND MEASURED THAT
<BREATH> WELL IF WE WELL WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE UM MEASURING WEIGHT IN CLASS SO
TWENTY GRAMS I THINK TWENTY ONE GRAMS OF WATER WAIT TWENTY FOUR GRAMS OF WATER
WELL YOU'RE LOOKING FOR UNTIL IT'S PERFECTLY LEVELED
YEAH
WELL IF YOU HAVE THIS REALLY HEAVY OBJECT YOU DON'T WANNA GO ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE
I DON'T KNOW REALLY <LAUGH> I DON'T KNOW
<LAUGH> AND THE AND THE DRY SPONGE WAS ABOUT THIS BIG IT WASN'T VERY BIG
WELL WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HOW MUCH HOW MUCH WATER A SPONGE CAN HOLD IN GRAMS SO
WELL WELL YOU DO YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF IT <LAUGH>
NO
YOU YOU TAKE OUT THE GRAMS ONE BY ONE AND COUNT THEM IT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH TO SUBTRACT FROM THE WET SPONGE
<BREATH> UM THE
AND MEASURING ANYTHING NO MEASURING HOW HEAVY IT IS
NO IT WAS WELL IT WAS CUT OUT FROM A BIGGER SPONGE SO SO WE A ALL OUR TABLES GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
AND SO WE TAKE THE DRY SPONGE AND WE PUT IT IN FIRST AND THEN WE MEASURED THAT OUT SO WE KNOW HOW MUCH TO SUBTRACT FROM FROM THE S S AND THEN WE
BECAUSE WELL IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LENGTH USUALLY IT'S LIKE UM METER LIKE ONE METER TWO METER STUFF LIKE THAT AND THIS ONE YOU SAY GRAM GRAM METER
CENTIMETERS THESE ARE ABOUT A CENTIMETER LONG WHICH IS AMAZING YEAH <LAUGH>
LIKE A KILOMETER IS ONE THOUSAND METERS
<LAUGH> I HAVE NO IDEA REALLY <LAUGH> I HAVE NO IDEA
THEN
<BREATH> GRAMS WELL THERE'S DIFFERENT SIZES OF GRAMS THERE ARE ONE GRAMS WHICH ARE BI ABOUT THIS BIG FIVE GRAMS WHICH ARE ABOUT THIS BIG AND THEN TEN GRAMS WHICH ARE ABOUT THIS BIG THIS BIG
PROBABLY
HE LIGHT VERY LIGHT
PROBABLY WHEN YOU'RE DOING LIKE MAYBE A YOGO OR SOMETHING <LAUGH> UH
NOT REALLY
HUNDRED THOUSAND <LAUGH> WOW
I DON'T KNOW <LAUGH>
YEAH BECAUSE THEN IF YOU PUT IN LIKE A TWENTY IT CAN GO LIKE THUNK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
NO NOT REALLY YOU JUST LOOK AT IT AND GUESS
WELL
YOU WAIT AND SO YOU PUT THE DRY SPONGE IN THE WATER AND YOU WAIT UNTIL IT GETS AS BIG AS IT CAN AND THEN YOU TAKE IT OUT THAT IT'S FILLED WITH WATER AND THEN YOU TAKE IT OUT AND IT DRIPS A LITTLE BIT SO YOU LET IT DRIP THEN YOU PUT IT IN THE IN THE SIDE AND IT'S
YEAH BUT IF IT'S IF IT'S TOO IF IT'S LIKE AN HEAVY ITEM YOU CAN GO BY FIVES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IF I HAD ANYTHING AT MY DISPOSAL I WOULD USE A
TWENTY WE GOT
SO WHEN YOU'RE MEASURING IT OUT WITH THE GRAMS THEN WHEN IT'S PERFECTLY LEVELED YOU SUBTRACT UM ONE OR TWO OF THE GRAMS FROM THE SPONGE SO THEN YOU KNOW THAT'S HOW MUCH WATER
MAYBE YEAH IT MAY BE MORE THAN ONE KILOGRAM
SO SAY WHEN I PUT THE DRY SPONGE IN IT'S LIKE THIS AND ANOTHER GRAM THEN ANOTHER GRAM THEN ANOTHER GRAM AND NOW IT'S PRETTY BALANCED RIGHT
<BREATH> WHEN WE USE METER IS LIKE
THERE'S LIKE A BILLION <LAUGH> CENTA- CENTIGRAMS IN A KILOGRAM SO UH
WITH A BALANCE
IT CAN GET MESSY <LAUGH>
AND THEN YOU PUT THEM PUT THE GRAMS IN ONE BY ONE AGAIN
UM UH HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THAT A DRY SPONGE CAN HOLD
IT'S EXTRA WATER
MAYBE THE LENGTH FROM
WELL THE SOAKED ONE WOULD DEFINITELY BE THE MOST THE DRY ONE WOULD DEFINITELY BE THE LIGHTEST AND THEN AND THEN THE WET ONE WOULD BE JUST IN THE MIDDLE
SPONGES SPONGES THEY SOAK UP WATER THEY HELP YOU CLEAN STUFF <LAUGH>
THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT RUN
CAUSE IT IS NOT A FULL COMPLETE CIRCUIT
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING CIRCUITS AND HOW THEY WORK AND TO MAKE HOW TO MAKE A FULL CIRCUIT
MEANS THE THE SOLAR CELL IS CONNECTING WITH THE SUNS ENERGY ABSORBING IT MAKING IT GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
THIS IS ABOUT THE SWITCHES GOING SO IT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TURN IT OFF AND ON WITHOUT MOVING THE WIRES
I NOTICE THAT IT IS
WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THE D CELL GOING OVER CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR MAKING THE MOTOR RUN AND IT IS GOING TO A THROUGH A THROUGH A CIRCUIT
IS SHOWING THAT THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES BOTH WIRES MAKING A CIRCUIT MAKING THE ENERGY MAKING THE ENERGY REUSE ITSELF GOING TO THE WIRE MAKING IT KEEP GOING FOREVER AND EVER UNLESS YOU MOVE A WIRE
VERY AWESOMENESS
THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO WIRES FACING THE SUN
THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND IT IS IMPORTANT AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN YOU KNOW IF THE ENERGY IS ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH OR NOT
THE THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR
THE SOLAR CELL WILL NOT ABSORB ENERGY FROM THE SUN AND IT WOULD STOP
A COMPLETE CIRCUIT SO YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE UM SWITCH BACK BECAUSE THE ENERGY HAS CONNECTED TO THAT THING THAT THE WIRES CONNECTED TO WITH THE SWITCH AND THE SWITCH HAS TO CONNECT TO THE OTHER WIRE OR METAL SO THE ENERGY IS CONNECTED TO THE METAL SO IT WILL GO THROUGH TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT GOING LIGHTING UP THE MOTOR EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID OR WHATEVER
IF THE SUN IS OUT THEN THERE IS ENERGY FLOWING FROM THE SUN TO THE SOLAR CELL MAKING IT LIGHT UP
THE ENERGY WASN'T CONNECTING TO THE OTHER WIRE MAKING IT GOING TO MAKING IT NOT GOING TO A COMPLETE CIRCUIT MAKING IT NOT MOVE OR DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT NOW THAT THE WIRE NOW THAT THE SWITCH HAS BEEN CONNECTED IT IS GOING AGAIN BECAUSE IT IS A COMPLETE CIRCUIT NOW
CELL IS FACING THE SUN MAKING THE SUNS ENERGY CONNECT THROUGH CONNECT THROUGH TO THE UM TO THE SOLAR TO THE SOLAR CELL MAKING THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO
WHAT ISN'T HAPPENING IN THE CIRCUIT IS ENERGY
I NOTICE THAT WHEN THE WIRE IS CONNECTED TO THAT OTHER METAL CONNECTED TO THE WIRE IT GOES BUT WHEN IT IS NOT AND IT IS SEPARATED IT DOES NOT GO
THAT MAKES THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE WIRES MAKING IT GO TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT UM UM HAVE ENERGY MAKING IT UM GO
WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN IT DOES NOT IT DOES NOT FLOW THE ENERGY DOES NOT FLOW THROUGH TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT NOT CONNECT AND MAKING IT NOT GO
WHAT MUST HAPPEN IS ENERGY MUST GO THROUGH THE WIRES GOING THROUGH A CIRCUIT GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT THE FLAG GO TO YOUR (())
THE SUN MAKES IT COME TO A REALLY SUNNY DAY MAKING THE SOLAR CELL ABSORB THE SUNS ENERGY GOING THOUGH THE WIRES UM CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO BUT IF IT IS A UM CLOUDY DAY THEN THERE IS NO SUN TO HAVE THE SOLAR CELL UM ABSORB ENERGY FROM SO IT WILL SO THERE IS NO ENERGY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES UM GOING TO THE MOTOR NOT MAKING IT RUN (())
YOU TOO
I NOTICE THAT IT IS NOT GOING
CLOSED
THAT THE FLAG IS MOVING
(()) IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE A BATTERY YOU CAN OUT IN THE SUN AND THEN IT WILL GET AND THEN IT WILL GET ENERGY FROM THE SUN IF IT IS CONNECTED TO THE WIRE THE ENERGY WILL FLOW THROUGH THE WIRE TO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BUILD IT FROM
BECAUSE THEY DO
COULD YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
DON’T
I NOTICED THAT THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING IN VERY RADICAL WAY
NO IT IS THAT IS IT GOING THROUGH AND MAKING A CIRCUIT THAT IS VERY BAD
IT IS GOING AROUND AND IT IS A CIRCUIT AND IT IS LIGHTING UP THE BOTH BULBS WITH ONE D-CELL AND WE DID THIS IN CLASS AND THE STUFF
CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
THEY ARE COMPARED BY THE SAME CIRCUIT AND STUFF AND BUT IT’S A MORE COMPLICATED FOR ME AND <NOISE>
VERY WELL NOT IT’S GETTING IT I AM NOT
OH NO AS WE-
IT’S BECAUSE THERE IS HARDER AND COMPLICATED AND STUFF LIKE THE THUNDER YEAH YEAH EXACTLY THUNDER HA LIKE THAT LIKE YEAH
IT GOES BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE
NO
KNEW
YEAH THIS IS THE CAT CLOCK
OKAY I DON’T KNOW THE PATHS ARE GOING IN A
WHAT
THEY ARE LIGHTING WITH ONLY D-CELL AND THAT WOULD IS VERY COMPLICATED TO ME
NOPE
I NOTICED THAT IS THAT IS A CIRCUITS YEAH A VERY GOOD CIRCUIT
I NOTICE THAT WHEN IT IS DISCONNECTED IT IS GOING BUT WHEN IT ISN’T CONNECTED IT IS GOING FOR SOME REASON I FORGOT YOUR QUESTIONS ANYWAY SO I THINK I’M RIGHT
COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN
I DON’T KNOW
THEY ARE FLYING IN A CIRCUIT AND THERE ARE ENERGY
THAT I DO NOT KNOW <INDISCERNIBLE>
WIDER OR BEING VERY COMPLICATE
I THINK THAT BECAUSE IT IS AND STUFF
THIS IS PARALLEL CIRCUIT
NOTICED THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING INTO AND IT IS CREATING A CIRCUIT
<NOISE>
I THINK THE CIRCUIT WOULD BE BEST FOR PARALLEL CIRCUIT
VERY BAD
THE WICK WHICH THE THING AND MAKES IT LIGHT
BECOMES POLLUTED I THINK UNLESS IT IS SOLAR POWERED CAR
IT IS ONLY ONE TIME USE AND COAL IS JUST AND COAL IT’S CAN STAY THERE FOR A LITTLE BIT LONG TIME
ENERGY IS BEING PRODUCED OUT BY THE SOUND BECAUSE IT IS BEING VIBRATED AND SOME ENERGY IS THE SOUND
I SEE WOOD WOOD GIVES FIRE SO WELL THE CANDLE THE FOOD THE APPLES IS STORED ENERGY THE CANDLE PRODUCES HEAT SO DOES THE WOOD AND THE OIL MAKES MORE FIRE PRETTY MUCH
NON-REUSABLE
WILL HAPPEN
IT WILL POLLUTE THE AIR
IT WILL COME FROM THE SUN TO THE SOLAR PANEL SO THE SOLAR ENERGY CELL AND IT WILL GO THROUGH THAT TRANSFERRING IT TO THE WIRES GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO
I DON’T KNOW
WELL BURN TO FIRE
USING ENERGY BECAUSE SHE IS WALKING GOING ON A <INDISCERNIBLE> BUT SHE’S ALSO PRODUCING ENERGY BECAUSE THE APPLE HAS ENERGY IN IT
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONNECTIONS AND HOW
IT DIDN’T SOUND LIKE ANYTHING
I SEE A CANDLE WICK BURNING AND THERE ARE IS A FLAME ON CANDLE WICK AND THEN THE WAD BELOW IT IS MELTING
WE OBSERVED THAT IT IS MELTING BECAUSE OF THE HEAT AND WAX IS MELT
AND IS PRODUCING IT OFF GIVING IT ENERGY AND THE SOUND IS THE ENERGY
OKAY CAN WE SKIP THIS
<NO_SIGNAL>
I SEE THAT THE FLAME IS PRODUCING HEAT AND THE STORED ENERGY FROM THE WAX IS GOING TO THE WICK GOING IT GOING TO THE FLAME MAKING IT LIGHT BUT IT IS GIVING BUT THE WAX IS GIVING AWAY ENERGY
<NO_SIGNAL>
<NO_SIGNAL>
SAY THAT AGAIN
CAN HEAR SOUND BECAUSE OF THAT <INDISCERNIBLE>
AND BECAUSE IT IS PRODUCING HEAT WHICH IS THE ENERGY MAKING IT FLOW ALSO WE KNOW IT IS ACTUALLY ENERGY AND SOME OTHER THING
IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF WE DIDN’T HAVE ENERGY WE WOULDN’T HAVE LIGHTER ANYTHING OR ANY LIKE THAT AND WE WOULDN’T HAVE THE UNIVERSE BECAUSE THE UNIVERSE IS MADE OUT OF ENERGY
THOSE WALKING AND EATING ENERGY WHICH IS KIND OF IMPOSSIBLE BUT ANY WAY
IS BURNING AND FLAMING IN HEAT
<NO_SIGNAL>
<NO_SIGNAL>
ARE WE DONE
WRAP IT AS CHEESE
LET TAKE US NO I JUST DO THIS AND THEN YOU AND THEN YOU SWIPE MY HAND YOU DON'T EVEN TURN TO DO IT
WHAT IS ALL ABOUT
SO FLOW <LAUGH> ALSO ON IT PUT THE BUTTON THAT SAY SHOW FLOW COME ON LET ME CLICK IT
NATHAN DID IT
<NO_SIGNAL>
HOW CAN I PUT THEM TOGETHER PLEASE TELL ME
EVERYTHING
IT'S NOT A MAGNET ANY MORE OH MY GOSH
EVERYTHING
I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL I DID SAY THAT AT ALL +HAHAHA+
IT GOES TO THE ATTIC
SORRY THAT'S NOT HOW IT GOES WE’VE BEEN ALLOWED WE’VE LOAD YOU’RE HURTING ME

WORKING JOYFULLY
A STEEL RIVET
IT HAS TO FLOW AGAIN IN PRE CIRCUITS LIKE MELO AND CHEESE MAKES TOGETHER
THEN SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN I GUARANTEE IT
EVERYTHING THIS IS CD AND YOU
DAVID WAS FLIRTING WITH A GIRL DAVID WAS FLIRTING WITH A HEY <INDISCERNIBLE> DAVID IS FLIRTING WITH A GIRL
WHAT TO ME
DAVID’S DAVID'S FLIRTING WITH A GIRL
GREAT THAT'S WHY IT WASN'T WORKING BECAUSE IT DIDN’T HIT THE SWITCH GET IT
MAGNETISM
REPEAT THIS
MAGNETIC FORCE MAGNETS <SIDE_SPEECH>
ARE YOU
THEY HAVE IRON
I NOTICED THAT THE MAGNET THE TWO MAGNETS HAVE A NORTH AND SOUTH SIDE WHICH WILL RED AND WHITE AND THAT THEY ARE STICKING TO THE FRIDGE WHICH IS MAGNETIC FOR IRON AND METALLIC ITEM IS
WELL YOU SEE THE WOOD DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL AND ANY OTHER MAGNET SO SUPER CONDUCTORS SO WILL NOT STICK
WELL ONE IS ALUMINIUM AND ONE IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON THE END
SUPER CONDUCTORS METAL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNET
I’M SORT OF BUSY REALLY BUSY YEAH
THE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON MAKING IT STICK TO THE MAGNET BUT THE WOOD IS NOT SO YEAH
STEEL AND IRON AND OTHER MAGNETS AND SUPER CONDUCTORS
BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR IS IRON AND STEEL AND THEY LIKE TO STICK TO METAL AND STEEL
WOOD BLOCK DOESN’T BECAUSE IT DOESN’T HAVE ANY OTHER IT DOESN’T HAVE ANY OTHER MAGNET OR ANY IRON OR STEEL AND IT DOESN’T HAVE A SUPER CONDUCTOR BUT THE NAIL DOES HAVE IRON AND STEEL I SAID THAT A LOT
THE ALUMINIUM NAIL IS NOT STICKING BECAUSE IT’S NOT PART OF THE <INDISCERNIBLE>
BECAUSE THE NAIL IS MADE OUT OF STEEL AND IRON
I THINK THE OBJECTS THAT THAT’S THAT HAVE BEEN STICKING HAVE THE METALLIC ITEMS THAT MAKES IT STICK TO THE MAGNET
<INDISCERNIBLE>
I DON’T KNOW
I’M SORRY AND BUSY YOU KNOW DON’T HAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR THAT
IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON AND STEEL BUT THE OTHER ONE IS MADE OUT OF ALUMINIUM WHICH WILL NOT STICK
METALLIC ELEMENTS
THE I DON’T KNOW BUT I DON’T WANT REALLY HAVE TIME FOR THIS PLEASE LET ME HURRY UP
I’M COLOR BLIND I AM COLOR BLIND SO I DON’T REALLY WHICH IS GREY
<NO_SIGNAL>

IT’S SOUTH AND SOUTH AND NORTH AND NORTH
A PERSON WITH A COMPASS
+AH+ I
THEY WOULD BE REPEL OBVIOUSLY
THEY ARE VERY MEDIC AND VERY METALLIC
<NO_SIGNAL>
THEY ARE SIMILAR BE WHAT THEY WERE NEVER MIND CAN WE MOVE ON
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING
NORTH AND NORTH ARE REPELLING SOUTH AND SOUTH ARE REPELLING NORTH AND SOUTH ATTRACT SOUTH AND NORTH ATTRACT- THE END OF THE STORY I LEARNED A LOT THAN YOU MUCH GOOD BYE
THE POLE ATTRACTS THE NORTH SIDE OF THE COMPASS AND THE SOUTH POLE ATTRACTS THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE COMPASS BECAUSE WE HAVE BECAUSE THE NORTH WE BECAUSE THE NORTH POLE AND THE SOUTH POLE ARE CONNECT ARE GENERATING MAGNETIC FIELDS TO PROTECT US FROM THE SUN'S SOLAR FLARES
MAGNETS
THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE WE SWITCHED THE SIDES AROUND SOUTH AND SOUTH OR NORTH AND NORTH CAN’T GO TOGETHER WHICH IS I THINK YOU’RE SMARTER THAN THIS YOU’RE AN ADULT
SOME ARE REPELLING AND SOME ARE ATTRACTING THE END END OF THE STORY I LEARNED A LOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
NOTICED THAT THEY ARE POPSICLE STICK IS NOT METAL AND IT'S WOOD SO THE ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH THAT SO THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING
SAID THEY ARE ALL METAL
THEY ARE INSULATORS BECAUSE THEY’RE NOT MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CANNOT FLOW THROUGH THEM
THE D-CELL BATTERY HAS A WIRE THROUGH THE LEFT SIDE GOING TO THE LEVER THE LEVER IS OPEN BUT THE NAIL IS THERE AND ITS METAL SO THE ENERGY CAN GO THROUGH GOING TO THE OTHER WIRE GOING TO THE OTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR MAKING IT GO AND THEN THE RIGHT SIDE IS JUST THE WIRE GOING TO THE MOTOR
IT HAS TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT METAL MAKING THE ENERGY NOT FLOW THROUGH IT YOU JUST ESTABLISHED THAT
THEY ARE CONDUCTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OUT OF METAL AND ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH METAL
I OBSERVED THAT THE PAPER CLIP IS METAL AND THAT SINCE METAL IT THE ENERGY IS FLOW LIKE THROUGH AND GOING TO THE MOTOR YEAH PRETTY WELL
INSULATORS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE OUT OF  METAL METAL
DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY AREN’T MADE OF METAL
THE METAL OR COPPER OR STEEL
THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE PAPERCLIP BECAUSE THE PAPERCLIP IS METAL
IT’S THE PARTS OF THE CIRCUITS OTHER CIRCUIT THAT IS ENERGY FLOWING BACK AROUND THROUGH THE D-CELL LIKE IT IS EVERY USING THE ENERGY MAKING IT MOVE THROUGH THE D-CELL
GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
THE MOTOR IS NOT RUNNING BECAUSE THE POPSICLE WILL- WELL THE STICK IS NOT METAL
<INDISCERNIBLE> MATTERS BECAUSE IF IT’S METAL THEN IT NEEDS TO BE-
THE NAIL AND THE SWITCH YOU KNOW THAT FUNKY STUFF
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT OTHER METAL OBJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN THAT CAN CONNECT ENERGY TO WIND ENERGY SOURCE
<NO_SIGNAL>
<NO_SIGNAL>
BECAUSE THERE IS LIKE
YEAH
MAGNITUDE IT'S HARD FOR THE MAGNETISM TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE THE PAPER IS THICK
IT WOULD NOT BE MAGNETISM THAT NO MORE LONG AND STUFF
THE MAGNETISM IS TRAVELLING THROUGH THE STEEL NAIL AND WHEN YOU REMOVE THE MAGNETS THE MAGNETISM IS STILL ON THE STEEL NAIL MAKING THE PAPERCLIPS STICK
IT CAN IT IS A MAGNETIC FIELD AND IT ATTRACT METAL THINGS TO MAGNETS
BECAUSE OF THE MAGNETISM
METAL AND MAGNETISM
<NO_SIGNAL>
MAGNETISM
IT IS NOT STICKING
THEY ARE BOTH MAGNETS
THE THICK STACK WOULDN'T BUT THE THINK STACK WOULD BECAUSE IT’S EASIER FOR MAGNETS TO <INDISCERNIBLE>
IT WORKED WELL THE THICK ONE DIDN’T WORK AND THE THICK AND THE THINK AND THE THINK ONE DIDN’T I MEAN DID
ON A MAGNET
MAGNETIC FORCE STICK IT TO <INDISCERNIBLE>
BECAUSE THEY OPPOSITE POLES AND OPPOSITE POLES ATTRACT
BECAUSE WE LEARNED THAT IN SCIENCE

IT BREAKS APART BY WASHERS <NOISE>
THERE ARE WASHERS IN THE OTHER CUP THAT ARE TRYING TO PULL AWAY THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE TWO MAGNETS MOVE
I OBSERVED THAT THE SPACERS ARE LIKE PREVENTING THE MAGNETIC FIELD YOU KNOW

<NO_SIGNAL>
IT’S TO WHAT- (*)
MAGNETIC
THERE IS A D CELL BATTERY WIRES AND A LIGHT BULB
OKAY
IS A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO GO THROUGH SO SO YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT BULB UM LIGHT
ARE SO YOU CAN POWER YOUR DEVICE OR LIGHT BULB SO IT WILL LIGHT UP OR SHOW YOU THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE
HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WIRES AND KINETIC ENERGY
I NOTICE THAT IT FLIPPED AROUND LIKE THIS
KINETIC ENERGY AND THEN CLOSED CIRCUIT
IT FLOWS BY GOING THROUGH THE WIRES GOING TO THE CASING OF THE BULB AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE CONNECTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BULB GOING OUT TO THE POSITIVE SIDE MAKING THE BULB HAVE A CIRCUIT LIGHTING IT UP
THE NEGATIVITY SIDE
I'M TALKING ALL RADICAL COME ON WOMAN TELL ME SOME ANSWERS
LIGHT BULBS ARE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE ENERGY GOT THERE AND YOU CAN SEE STUFF
I SEE A CIRCUIT
(())
I AM REALLY GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
SAVES THE ENERGY TO LIGHT IT UP
ENERGY
THINK THAT IT WILL NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE NEEDS ONE TO BE AT THE SIDE OF THE BULB FOR THE ENERGY TO FLOW OUT CAUSE IF IT'S AT THE BOTTOM THEN THERE'S ONLY JUST ONE BULB CONNECTING TO IT OR I MEAN WIRE
IS FLOWING THROUGH THE D CELL POSITIVE SIDE AND GOING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE INTO THE BULB BUT IT IS COMING OUT THE BULB AGAIN INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE MAKING IT A CIRCUIT
I THINK I NEVER MIND
THEY HELP THE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE D CELL SO THE BULB CAN ACTUALLY LIGHT UP
TELL YOU MORE ABOUT WHAT
I NOTICE THAT IT'S LIGHTING UP OF COURSE
I NOTICE THAT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH A LITTLE TUBE BUT THERE IS A THIN WIRE BETWEEN IT THAT MAKES THE ENERGY SQUEEZE THROUGH IT GOING OUT IT GOING OUT IT GOING THROUGH THE WIRE AGAIN AND RECYCLING IT THROUGH THE BATTERY
I NOTICE THAT IT'S MAKING THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
BE CONNECTED TO MAKE THE ENERGY FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES SO THE TO SO THE LIGHT BULBS CAN
I AM ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE FORTY FOUR I MEAN FORTY FIVE CENTIMETERS TALL AND UM THAT WOULD FROM MY HEAD TO MY TOE AND MY ARM TO MY WRIST TO MY ANKLE WAS UM ONE HUNDRED CENTI- ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY UM ONE HUNDRED AND TEN CENTIMETERS LONG
THEY'RE BOTH THE
<BREATH> IT'S IN METERS METERS CENTIMETERS MEASUREMENT AND YARDS THAT'S HOW THAT'S HOW YOU THOSE ARE THE TOOLS YOU CAN MEASURE WITH TO MEASURE HEIGHT OR LENGTH
YOU CAN USE CENTIMETERS OR INCHES
ER WHAT WAS IMPORTANT IS TO LEARN CENTIMETERS INCHES MILLIMETERS UM YARDS AND FEET
THIS BOY IS ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN CENTIMETERS TALL
YOU CAN FIND THEM ON YARD STICKS I THINK I MEAN METER STICKS AND RULERS
WELL YOU WOULD NEED A METER STICK OR A YARD STICK TO DO THIS OR A TAPE MEASURE AND THE REASON YOU WOULD USE THOSE IS BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER THAN RULERS AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAN MEASURE A CLASSMATE
<BREATH> WELL HEIGHT YOU COULD USE A WEAR A SCALE WHAT IT'S A HARD QUESTION I DON'T KNOW
I DO NOT KNOW
YES GOOD
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS START AT A CORNER AND IT WILL ALWAYS GET YOU WHERE YOU NEED
YOU CAN USE A HAND OR YOU COULD USE A RULER OR YOU CAN USE YOUR PINKIE
WELL IF YOU COUNT THE LINES YOU CAN COUNT TEN EACH SO THAT WOULD EQUAL AND THEN YOU CAN KNOW THAT'S ALWAYS TEN CENTIMETERS BUT THAT WASN'T A HALF SO YOU COULD TELL
YOU CAN TAKE A YARD STICK OR A METER STICK AND YOU CAN MEASURE ARM *SPAN* AND YOU CAN ALSO USE A TAPE MEASURE AND YOU CAN CAUSE THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT LONGER SOME OF THEM CAN BE A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND YOU CAN UM USE THEM TO MEASURE YOUR ARM *SPAN*
WELL IT'S MEASURING HOW LONG YOUR FROM ONE O FROM YOUR LEFT ARM TO YOUR RIGHT ARM AND YOU CAN MEASURE AND THAT'S WHAT ARM SPAN IS
YOUR FOOT IS VERY USEFUL BECAUSE IT COULD BE LIKE A FEW INCHES OR A FEW CENTIMETERS IF YOU COUNT IT AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CENTIMETERS OR SOMETHING IT IS BUT IT IS UM VERY IMPORTANT TO USE FEET CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY FEET INSTEAD OF HANDS OR PINKIES
A PINKIE FINGER IS ABOUT ONE CENTIMETER LONG TH I MEAN TALL WIDE AND TALL WIDE WIDE I MEAN AND IF YOU ALWAYS MEASURE WITH YOUR PINKIE YOU'D ALWAYS GET A CENTIMETER
BECAUSE YOUR ANSWER MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE RIGHT OR CORRECT BECA- IT COULD UM MESS UP AND YOU THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD MEASURE MORE THAN ONCE
I MEASURED MY HEAD MY BICEPS MY EARS MY FINGERS MY FOOT MY LEGS MY ARMS AND ALL OVER MY BODY EXCEPT FOR MY EYES AND MY LIPS
IT'S A TABLE
YOU WOULD NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WIDE IT WOULD BE HOW TALL IT WOULD BE AND HOW LONG IT WOULD BE AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS YOU'RE VERY PRETTY
YOU CAN MEASURE FINGERS YOU COULD FI UM YOU COULD UM DO YOU COULD UM DO STUFF WITH IT
WELL THE WIDTH IS ONE CENTIMETER LONG UM I'M PREDICTING AND AND I FORGOT THE REST
BYE MARNIE
I MEASURED MY FOOT THE SIZE OF MY NECK AND THE EAR THE UM THE NOSE AND WE MEASURED HOW TALL WE ARE AND OUR ARM *SPAN* WAS
IT IS BIGGER THAN A RULER AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE MOST MOST MORE COMMON
WELL A HAND IS TEN IS TEN IN TEN INCHES LONG AND I MEAN TEN CENTIMETERS LONG AND YOU CAN USE MY HANDS CAUSE YOU CAN TELL THAT IT'S TEN CENTIMETERS
WELL THE REASON WHY YOU SHOULD MEASURE MORE THAN ONCE IS CAUSE YOUR ANSWER SHOULD ISN'T ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE SAME AS THE FIRST TIME MAYBE BUT IF IT IS THE SAME THEN YOU'RE PROBABLY CORRECT YOU SHOULD KEEP DOING IT UNTIL LIKE THREE OR TWO TIMES UNTIL YOU IF YOU GET THE SAME ANSWER THEN IT COULD BE CORRECT
A METER TAPE BECAUSE IT'S NOT STIFF IT WOULD BE FLABBY SO YOU CAN MEASURE UNDER NECK
AND SOME ARE DIFFERENT LENGTHS THAN OTHERS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT GRAMS ARE ALL ABOUT I DO NOT KNOW
MEASURING
WELL YOU COULD PROBABLY GET THE SAME ANSWER
WELL AN PROBABLY AN APPLE WOULD BE LIGHTER AND AN ORANGE WOULD BE HEAVIER AND YOU TAKE THE GRAMS AND YOU PUT THEM INTO THE CUP OKAY YOU PUT AN ORANGE OR AN APPLE OR SOMETHING YOU PUT SOMETHING IN ONE CUP AND THEN YOU PUT S AND THEN YOU PUT THE GRAMS IN THE OTHER CUP AND SEE IF IT WILL BALANCE
UH-HUH <BREATH> UH I DO NOT KNOW
IT IS EIGHT GRAMS
I DO NOT BETWEEN YOU AND ME I DO NOT KNOW SORRY
OH WELL I'M A LITTLE SHOT TODAY SO I'M SORRY BUT UM IT'S BALANCED AND YOU WANT TO KEEP SOMETHING BALANCED IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH IT IS IN GRAMS CENTIMETERS
PLEASE REPEAT IT
<BREATH> IT TOOK TWO HUNDRED I MEAN THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAMS TO TO TO KEEP IT BALANCED TO GET THE ORANGE TO BALANCE
A THOUSAND GRAMS EQUALS ONE KILOGRAM <BREATH>
THE ORANGE IS TOO HEAVY AND SO YOU'LL NEED MORE GRAMS TO TO MAKE IT BALANCE
OKAY <BREATH> UM WELL THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH BALANCED
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT REFERENCE IS OR WHAT IT ME
WELL FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK BUT BETWEEN YOU AND ME I LOVE YOU SO UM KILOGRAMS IS LIKE A THOUSAND KILOGRAMS IS THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PIECES OF GRAMS AND I FORGOT MY AND I FORGOT AND I'M MAKING A LAME EXCUSE
UM WELL THE PAPER CLIP IS ONE GRAM THE COIN IS FIVE GRAMS THE WHOLE BUNCH OF PAPER CLIPS ARE TEN GRAMS AND THE WHOLE BUNCH OF COINS ARE FIFTY GRAMS
I I I I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
WELL THE SMALL THING IS ONE GRAM FIVE GRAMS TEN GRAMS TWENTY GRAMS
WELL A KILOGRAM I DON'T VERY KN- I DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH OF A KILOGRAM I JUST I JUST HEARD OF THE WORD KILOGRAM REALLY WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT KILOGRAMS IN CLASS
WE'VE BEEN WEIGHING THINGS
IT TOOK ONE KILOGRAM ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY GRAM IT TOOK ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY GRAMS TO TO MAKE THE BOOT BALANCE
VERY GOOD THANK YOU
UM WELL I DON'T KNOW
WHEN SOMETHING IS VERY HEAVY AND YOU USE MORE THAN A THOUSAND IT'S ONE KILOGRAM
THESE ARE GRAMS
IT TAKES SEVENTY GRAMS TO FIT THAT TOY C TO MEASURE THAT TOY CAR AND KEEP IT NICE AND BALANCED
THREE GRAMS THREE LITTLE CUTE BLACK SAY EQUALS THREE GRAMS EQUALS ONE GRAM EACH WHICH IS THERE'S THREE THREE GRAMS IS MEASURING IS BALANCING THE WOODEN CHIPPY THINGY I DON'T I DON'T I'M SCARED I'M SORRY
WELL YOURS MIGHT BE NOT RIGHT IF EVERYBODY'S IS THE SAME BECAUSE YOU COULD CHECK AGAIN AND THEN YOU COULD GET KILOGRAMS LIKE IF SOMEBODY'S HAS LIKE TWO KILOGRAMS AND I HAD ONE KILOGRAM THAT MEANS I MISSED SOMETHING
WELL IN CLASS WE MEASURED A PENCIL AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS FIVE GRAMS
I FORGOT
GOOD
THE DOORKNOB ON THE PICTURE
BRAIN CAN HELP YOU ESTIMATE AND
SO YOU CAN MEASURE THINGS THAT ARE BIGGER THAN RULERS
A DOORKNOB MEAN A A KNOB ON A DOOR
YOU CAN USE A METER STICK BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF VERY LONG IT'S BIGGER THAN A RULER LIKE <BREATH> EVERY TIME YOU MEASURE WITH A METER STICK YOU CAN UM YOU CAN GET BIGGER AMOUNTS WITH BIG THINGS
YOU CAN USE YOUR HANDS OR YOUR FEET THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT A BIG FOOT OR A LITTLE HAND
I FORGOT SOR SORRY
WELL MY RUG AT HOME IS AS LONG AS A METER BECAUSE I'VE MEASURED IT WITH A METER STICK WELL ACTUALLY MY MOTHER'S RUG BECAUSE SHE'S THE TEACHER
I DO NOT KNOW
YOU CAN WEIGH A LOT OF THINGS AND AND IT IS VERY COOL AND YOU CAN UM LIKE ME AND MY FRIEND SARAH SHE I SHE WEIGHS FORTY MY BEST FRIEND IS A DOG AND SHE WEIGHS FORTY EIGHT POUNDS AND SHE IS SHE IS TEN METERS TEN METERS
IT IS ALMOST TO LIKE AN INCH OR CENTIMETERS LIKE TEN CENTIMETERS YOUR PINKIE IS AND A HAND IS TEN IS UM FIFTY CENTIMETERS I THINK
BECAUSE YOU CAN MEASURE A LOT OF THINGS WITHOUT MEASURING YOU COULD VERY WELL JUST UM NOT KNOW ANYTHING ON HOW TO MEASURE SO WE NEED MEASURING A LOT THAT'S WHY WE MEASURE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN STUDYING A LITTLE BIT IN SCHOOL
GOOD IT
IT IS TEN CENTIMETERS ON IN THIS PICTURE
<BREATH> ALL THOSE HANDS IT IS FIFTY CENTIMETERS ALL IN ALL
YOU CAN UM MEASURE WITH THEM EVEN WITH A RULER
THREE CENTIMETERS I MEAN THREE INCHES LONG
WE HAVE BEEN MEASURING
I UH
I SEE A ONE METER TEN METERS A HUNDRED METER AND A THOUSAND METERS
I DO NOT KNOW
UM WELL A METER STICK IS LONGER THAN STRAWS AND THEY HAVE NUMBERS ON THEM SO IF YOU'RE LINING UP CORRECTLY YOU CAN GET YOUR LENGTH THAT YOU REALLY WANT
I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T LIKE YOU
THE METRIC SYSTEM I DO NOT KNOW THAT QUESTION I I FORGOT THE QUESTION SO I DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW SO SORRY
WE HAVE BEEN MEASURING AND WE HAVE BEEN USING AND WE HAVE BEEN USING MEASUREMENTS AND LENGTH AND WE'VE BEEN WEIGHING STUFF
WHEN YOU ESTIMATE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT CAUSE YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING IT'S KIND OF LIKE A GUESS ONLY YOU WANT TO GET TO THE CLOSEST NUMBER THERE LIKE IN A JAR YOU HAVE TO ASK ME HOW MANY JELLY BEANS
YOU CAN ALL MEASURE WITH THEM AND THEY'RE ALL MEASURING TOOLS THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS USE WHEN YOU NEED THEM
TO SHOW THAT UM LENGTH YOU COULD DO WIDE OR HIGH YOU CAN DO THE LENGTH OR THE WIDTH AND YOU CAN UM OH SHOOT I JUST FORGOT
YOU CAN MEASURE AND YOU CAN MEASURE THE WIDTH OR HOW LONG IT IS
THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT CAUSE THE METAL WASHER
I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
I DO NOT KNOW
WE USED UM WE WE USED GRAMS
I DO NOT KNOW
YOU CAN WEIGH THEM WITH A SCALE
GOOD
I DON'T KNOW
THE METAL WASHER IS HEAVIER THAN THE CHIP <BREATH>
THE WOODEN WASHER THE WASHER THE THE WOODEN BLOCK AND THE CHIP THEN THE CHIP
WELL IT'S GOING HEAVY LIGHT LIGHT LIGHT LITTLE
BYE MARNIE
<BREATH> ONE PAPER CUP'S SMALL ONE PAPER CUP'S BIG
I DON'T KNOW
I DO NOT KNOW <LAUGH> <BREATH>
YOU CAN DO LIKE ONE GRAM TWO GRAMS THREE GRAMS FOUR GRAMS ALL THE WAY UNTIL INFINITY
WELL YOU COULD UM I FORGOT I FORGOT
WELL MEASURING IT'S LIKE BUT WELL UM I FORGOT
IT IS BALANCED BECAUSE THERE ARE UM <LAUGH> I FORGOT <BREATH>
WELL IF SOMETHING'S NOT BALANCED YOU CAN USE PAPER CLIPS AND SEE THEN YOU MAKE IT MEASURE THE SO IT'S IN THE MIDDLE
METAL'S HEAVIER THAN PLASTIC THAT'S THE ANSWER
WELL THE PICTURE SHOWED ME THAT THAT THE METAL WASHER WAS H THE HEAVIEST AND THEN
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
WELL IT'LL BE BALANCED
ON SEVEN SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE THEN THE METAL WASHER GETS HEAVIER IN GRAMS
BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO BALANCE IT AND THEN YOU CAN GET IT TO DO SOMETHING
THESE ARE PAPER CLIPS
BECAUSE THE SCALE CAN TELL IF IT'S HEAVY OR NOT AND YOUR HANDS THEY HAVE LOTS OF MUSCLES SO THEY DON'T AND THEY CAN JUST GO FLAPPING ANY WAY THEY WANT
WELL IN CLASS WE UM USED UM A WEIGHING TOOL AND THE AND TO GET THEM BALANCED WE HAD TO USE FOUR PAPER CLIPS TO GET IT BALANCED
THE LITTLE CUBE IN FRONT OF ME AND IT EQUALS ONE GRAM
WELL THERE ARE WEIGHTS THAT ARE LIKE UH HEAVIEST TO LIGHTEST
WELL THE CHIP IS VERY LIGHT AND THEN IF THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE OTHER CUP THERE WOULD UM THEN THE CHIP WOULD BE THE HEAVIEST BUT THEY ADD PAPER CLIPS IN IT AND THEN THEY SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS AND THEN IT CAN BE BALANCED
WELL SMALL PAPER CLIP WOULD YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUT MORE AND A BIG PAPER CLIP YOU WOULD HAVE TO USE LESS
IN THIS PICTURE IT TAKES EIGHT GRAMS TO FILL THAT METAL WASHER
WELL THE FIR THE HEAVIEST WOULD BE THE MAGNET MAYBE THEN THE THEN THE WOODEN THEN THE WOOD BLOCK AND THEN THE CHIP
WELL THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T GET THE SAME RESULTS BECAUSE ONE'S HEAVIEST AND ONE'S NOT HEAVIEST
WHAT I GOT IT CLASS WAS WE HAD TO USE FIVE GRAMS TO MEASURE EIGHT I MEAN TWO GRAMS TO MEASURE A CHIP
I DON'T KNOW
WELL UM IT'S MORE ACCURATE <BREATH>
<BREATH> WELL VIAL TWO COULD HOLD LESS AND VIAL ONE COULD HOLD MORE LIKE TWICE THAT MUCH OF VIAL TWO
THAT SHOWS US ONE MILLILITER
WELL THIS WATER'S HOLDING A THOUSAND MILLILITERS OR ONE ONE KILOGRAM
UM WELL I FORGOT
FIRST ONE A HUNDRED *MILLILITERS* AND THE BIG FAT TUBIE THING THOUSAND MILLILITERS
<BREATH> WELL THAT VIAL COULD PRO GROUP
BECAUSE YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT RESULTS BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER CAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER AND YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT RESULTS THAT WAY
I FORGOT WHAT THIS IS
WELL YOU WOULD PULL THE TU BLACK THING OUT
I DO NOT KNOW THAT ANSWER <BREATH>
<BREATH> WHEN YOU BAKE A CAKE YOU CAN USE MILLILITERS
IT CAN HOLD DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF THINGS THAT YOU NEED
BECAUSE IT HAS A FEW UM INCHES MILLIMETERS OR LITERS
UM LITERS ARE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO SOMETHING WITH AND IT CAN MEASURE HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN WEIGH OR HOW HIGH IT COULD POSSIBLY HOLD
WELL WE'VE BEEN MEASURING AND WE'VE BEEN MEASURING
IT TAKES TEN LITTLE TUBIES TO FILL TO MAKE A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
I FORGOT
<BREATH> WELL THE SKINNY ONE CAN HOLD A HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND THE BIG TUBIE THINGY CAN HOLD A THOUSAND MILLILITERS ONE IS SKINNY AND ONE IS VERY FAT
WELL IT COULD BE USED FOR UM SCIENCE
GOOD
MEASUREMENT MEASUREMENT
WELL THESE ARE LINES THAT THAT CAN PROBABLY TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT CAN PROBABLY HOLD
A LITER CAN BE BROKEN DOWN LIKE IF YOU CAN HAVE LIKE LIKE IF YOU HAD A MEASURING CUP YOU COULD BREAK DOWN LIKE FIVE OR AS MANY LITERS AS YOU WANT TO MAKE A CAKE OR SOMETHING LIKE A CUPCAKE OR A CAKE POP TART OR SOMETHING
UH WELL IT CAN PROBABLY HOLD LIKE
UM MILLILITERS IS HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD OR HOW HIGH IT CAN GO WITH THE LINES
A MILLIMETER IS BIGGER AND A LITER IS SMALLER
GALLON
METERS
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN MEASURING
I DON'T KNOW
IT IS MILLIMETERS MILLIMETERS IN THE SYRINGE
YOU COULD USE A MEASURING CUP
UM WELL IT CAN TELL YOU HOW HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD OR HOW MUCH IT CAN
UM THE BIG TUBE THE BIG TUBE HA CAN HAVE FOUR MILLILITERS AND I MEAN IT TAKES FOUR FOUR OF THOSE TO FILL UP EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT MILLIMETERS AND IT TAKES NINE IN THE SECOND VIAL TO IT TAKES NINE TO MAKE EIGHTY EIGHT MILLILITERS BECAUSE ONE IS BIG AND ONE IS SMALL
MEASURING
IT SUCKS UP WATER AND THEN IT'S IT OUT THEN YOU PUSH PULL SUCKS IN PUSH S
IT IS NOT PUTTING AS MUCH AS IT COULD
IT COULD HOLD THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS INSTEAD IT HOLDS THREE HUNDRED <BREATH>
OKAY UM UM AND IT SHOWS YOU WHAT
<BREATH> WELL I CAN'T REALLY PUT THIS INTO WORDS I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT THIS INTO WORDS <BREATH> SORRY <BREATH>
YOU COULD JUST USE THE SYRINGE AND SUCK IT OUT OR YOU COULD POUR IT OUT
VOLUME IS WHAT'S THERE AND THE CAPACITY IS WHAT IT CAN POSSIBLY HOLD THAT'S WHAT I SEE IN THE PICTURE
IT WILL MO IT MOST LIKELY WILL SHOW YOU ON THAT THING LIKE THE SYRINGE HAS FORTY A HUNDRED
UM MILLILITERS ARE UM A TYPE OF ALRIGHT I FORGOT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY I'M SO SORRY
IT'S LIKE THE TOTAL CAPACITY THAT IT COULD HOLD IS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE BUT IT HOLDS THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS
THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS
<BREATH> UM YOU COULD POUR TO THE BRIM
<BREATH> CAPACITY IS UM WHAT THE WHAT THE UM CAN CAN POSSIBLY WHAT <COUGH> UM WHAT IT CAN PO WHAT SOMETHING CAN POSSIBLY
THE TWOS OR THE UNITS I
UM I CAN'T REALLY ANSWER THAT WITH MY LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE NOT SAYING THAT I'M DUMB
H UM WITH THE SYRINGE YOU COULD ADD YOU COULD ADD FIFTY <BREATH> A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED THREE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE HUNDRED AND THEN <BREATH>
<BREATH> YOU COULD SQUIRT IT INTO A BEATER BEAKER NOT A BEATER
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING EXACTLY I'M SORRY
<BREATH> IT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
<BREATH> UM IT DOESN'T HOLD AS MUCH AS WELL THAT'S HOW MUCH IT COULD POSSIBLY HOLD IT'S NOT WELL IN REAL LIFE IT'S PROBABLY NOT HOLDING AS MUCH AS THAT
<BREATH> YOU COULD USE SYRINGES AND JUST MEASURE THAT THAT'S PROBABLY BE EASIER
HI <BREATH>
THEY'RE A BEAKER A GRADUATED CYLINDER AND A SYRINGE THEY ALL MEASURE UM VOLUME
<BREATH> CAPACITY IS HIGHER THAN THE VOLUME
MASS WEIGHT <BREATH>
THE SYRINGES ARE FILLING UP THEY EACH HAVE FIFTY OH BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WATER THERE'S ONLY ENOUGH FOR FORTY TWO SO IT HAS A HUNDRED AND FORTY
MEASURE MASS AND THE CAPACITY OF THINGS AND THE VOLUME
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND UM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING <BREATH> <BREATH>
IT'S THE CAN CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
<BREATH> UM I DON'T UNDERSTAND
MASS ACTUALLY VOLUME OKAY
IT'S NOT FILLED TO THE VERY TOP
YOU COULD TAKE A SYRINGE AND POUR ONE WATER TWO WATER AND SO ON AND SO ON UNTIL YOU GET
WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT IF WE WERE BEING CHEATED <BREATH> LIKE THE SODA CAN DIDN'T HOLD AS MUCH AS IT AC ACTUALLY SAID IT HAS UM OR IF WE WO
VOLUME IS HOW MUCH COULD IT THERE IS AND CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH IT CAN POSSIBLY HO
I DON'T EXACTLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I'M SO SORRY BUT I DON'T
YOU COULD TAKE A SYRINGE AND DO IT I GUESS <BREATH>
IT'S HAS MUCH AS THE CAN CAN POSSIBLY HOLD
THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT CAPACITY
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH WATER TO MAKE ANOTHER FIFTY
EVERY TEN MILLILITERS <BREATH>
IT'S FIFTY IT'S FIFTY MIL
UM I DON'T KNOW YOU WOULD PUT THE WATER IN THE SYRINGE AND WE WOULD SPRAY IT INTO SOMETHING TO SEE HOW MUCH IT IS
WELL WE HAVEN'T REALLY STUDIED CAPACITY SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW
GOOD
WHEN WE PREDICT YOU COULD MAKE AN ESTIMATE AND MAKE A LINE AND SEE IF IT'LL GO OVER OR UNDER
IT IS A GRADUATED CYLINDER
UM ESTIMATING IS WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN EST
<BREATH> WATER
WELL SYRINGE CAN UM CAN <BREATH> MMM
WELL I AM SEEING FIFTY MILLIMETERS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS WE HAVEN'T EVEN STUDIED ABOUT CAPACITY
S THEY COULD PROBABLY ALL HOLD THE SAME THING IT COULD JUST BE HIGHER FATTER SKINNIER AND THEY COULD JUST ALL HOLD THE SAME THING
WE WHAT IT IS DOING IT IS UM TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER BUT UM IT IS UM
WELL THERE'S MORE GRADUATED CYLINDERS THAT ARE FATTER AND THEY CAN EQUAL A THOUSAND MILLILITERS
IT COULD HOLD FIFTY MILLILITERS FILL UP A CUP WITH IT
THE LINES REPRESENT UH HOW MANY IT HOLDS
PUT WATER IN IT
WELL I DON'T KNOW I HAVE TO FIND THAT OUT
I DON'T KNOW
UH A GRADUATED CYLINDER WOULD KIND OF BE LIKE UM GET A PIE ONE WILL BE A BIGGER PIE AND REALLY A SMALL PIE
WELL THEY COULD ALL HOLD THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER
UH CAPACITY IS WHERE YOU PUT A C WATER IN A CONTAINER AND YOU FILL IT UP AND IT'S CAPACITY
CAN SHOW HOW MUCH IT CAN TAKE HOW MUCH IT'LL HOLD BUT IT WILL EVENTUALLY STOP AT FIFTY MILLILITERS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS AT ALL
<BREATH> I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M OBSERVING I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAPACITY IS
UM YOU CAN MEASURE WATER IN OR LIQUIDS IN IT
TE WE COULD TAKE WATER AND THEN YOU COULD PULL IT UP
THE CUP ON THE LEFT HAS MORE THAN THE CUP ON THE RIGHT
WELL WE'D USE A SYRINGE WE WELL WE U USED A SYRINGE DURING CLASS AND FILLED IT UP WITH WATER AND SEE HOW MANY CU- HOW MANY FIFTY POUNDS FIFTY THINGS WATER FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER AND THEN WE COULD SEE HOW MUCH COULD FILL UP A CUP
IT SAYS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER VESSEL
I THINK IT CAN HOLD WATER EXCEPT THIS ONE CAN HOLD HUNDRED MILLILITERS
CAUSE IT CAN HOLD FIVE TEN
WELL IT TOOK AWAY UM WELL IT TOOK AWAY UM MARK SEE
WE'VE BEEN WEIGHING A LOT OF THINGS
THEY COUL- WELL EVERY ONE EVERY SINGLE ONE YOU PUT IN IS A HUNDRED AND EQUALS TWO TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER
CAPACITY IS
ALL ABOUT HEIGHT AND I FORGOT
NO
UH I DON'T GET THE QUESTION
YES
I THINK IT'S REALLY FUN AND THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF STRAWS LIKE YOU CAN CUT AND YOU CAN UM MEASURE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIZES WITH STRAWS
YES
YES
HI UH HI MY NAME IS CATHERINE AND I'M NINE YEARS OLD WILL YOU TELL ME A QUESTION
NO
WELL UM I DO NOT KNOW
A LITTLE BIT
A YARD STICK A RULER AND UM <BREATH> A METER STICK
I DO NOT KNOW THAT QUESTION
I FORGOT
AND TALL AND S AND TEN SMALL STRAWS LONG AND WIDE
I GOT IT TO WORK
IT'S WHERE YOU CAN UM USE A RULER A YARDSTICK OR SOMETHING TO WEIGH AND YOU CAN UM FIND OUT HOW LONG OR WIDE IT IS
MEASURING DECLINE AND SUMMIT
THEY'RE TUBES <BREATH>
IT WILL CAN TELL YOU <BREATH>
WELL IT WOULD PROBABLY BE AT FOUR
AT BELOW ZERO IT'S CELSIUS
UM WE PUT UH HOW MUCH CELSIUS
WELL IT SHOW ME THAT'S COLD AND IT CAN TELL THE TEMPERATURE OF IT
I FORGOT DANG IT
OH <BREATH> WELL THE WATER GETS COLDER AND THE TEMPERATURE DROPS
WE OBSERVED TEN MINUTES
THE TEMPERATURE DROP
UM WELL EVERY SINGLE MINUTE THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED WITH THE <BREATH> WITH THE CUP WITH THE ICE IN IT
GOOD
TEN CELSIUS
ONE OF THEM SAYS FIFTY FIVE ONE OF THEM SAYS A HUNDRED AND ONE OF THEM SAYS FIVE ONE OF THEM SAYS TWEN-
WELL WHEN WE CALL THEM AND IF THE AND IF THE THERMOMETER BREAKS YOU CAN DIE FROM IT THE LIQUID THAT'S INSIDE A THERMOMETER
IT'S CALLED UM *MILLERIA* AND WHEN IT GET HOTTER IT GOES UP
MOVING HIGHER
<BREATH> WELL WE DID UM EVERY MINUTE WE WOULD CHECK OUR THERMOMETER AND SEE WHAT ARE THING WERE
WELL AT START IT WAS AT TWENTY CELSIUS AND THEN AT THE FINISH IT WAS BELOW ZERO IT WAS ZERO CELSIUS
I DON'T KNOW I FORGOT
UM IT GOES UP GOV AND IT GOES DOWN
AW SHOOT I JUST FORGO
I DON'T KNOW BYE BYE
WELL EVERY SINGLE MINUTE WE <BREATH> WELL ACTUALLY WE PUT UM ICE WELL ACTUALLY WE GOT SOME WARM WATER AND WE PUT IT IN A CUP AND WE PUT ICE IN IT AND THEN EVERY MINUTE WE CHECKED THE THERMOMETER AND SEE WHAT THE TEMPERATURE WA
JUST FOR SECOND THIRD FOURTH <BREATH>
IT DROPPED
WELL WHEN IT GETS HOTTER IT GETS GAS IN IT <BREATH> AND THAT MAKES THE RED STUFF GO UP
I FORGOT
WELL IT CHANGES BECAUSE THE ARE COLD AND IT'LL FREEZE
WELL WHEN SOMETHING GOES DOWN IT MMM YOU PUT THE THERMOMETER
THIS
IT GOES UP AND IT GOES
I DON
IT SAYS FIFTEEN CELSI-
WELL YOU SHOULD AND THEN IF YOU COUNT YOUR WAY UP TO WHERE THE UM THERMO
I DON'T KNOW
I FORGO
WELL WE LOOKED AT THE THERMOMETER AND IT HA
I CAN TELL THEY HAVE DIFFERENT VARIABLES
SUBSTANCE C IS TWELVE GRAMS
THEY ARE ICE THEY ARE SALT CRYSTALS
SUBSTANCE C
IT'S A CHART
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SATURATION
(())
GOOD
THE DIFFERENCE IS THERE IS RESIDUE
CITRIC ACID
WHAT I THINK WAS HAPPENING WAS THE SALT WAS DISSOLVING AND THEN YOU PUT IT YOU FILTERED IT AND WEIGHED IT ON THE SCALE
EPSOM SALT
CITRIC ACID
YOU CHECK ON THE CRYSTAL IDENTIFICATION CHART
YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE DESCRIPTION IS OF THE CRYSTALS AND MATCH THEM TOGETHER
THAT DIFFERENCE IS YOU PUT FOUR SCOOPS OF CITRIC ACID AND SIX SCOOPS OF SUGAR
THE TRAIL MIX HAS THREE DIFFERENT PILES THE PEANUTS THE RAISINS AND THE M&MS SO THEY ARE NOT A MIXTURE YET
COOL
A SOLUTE
WELL WHAT THEY DO MARNI IS THAT SO WHEN YOU PUT THE SALT IN THE WATER AND YOU STIR IT THEY'LL JUST TOTALLY DISSOLVE AND I ACTUALLY I'M NOT REALLY SURE MARNI COULD YOU TELL ME WHY
HOW THE MIXTURES CHANGE MARNI IS BECAUSE THE THE SCREEN CAUGHT THE SAND AND THEN CAUSE THE HOLES WERE SMALLER THAN THE SAND SO THE SAND JUST STAYED RIGHT THERE BUT THE WATER IS SMALLER THAN THE HOLES SO IT JUST WENT RIGHT THROUGH OKAY
WE CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY IN THE WATER AND THAT DOESN'T DISSOLVE OR SINK TO THE BOTTOM AND IT CAN'T GO THROUGH A FILTER EITHER
THE MIXTURE THE SALT WILL BE GETTING DISSOLVED INSTEAD OF THE WATER BEING DISSOLVED INTO THE SALT AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S JUST WORKS I DON'T KNOW MARNI I JUST REALLY NEED HELP WITH IT
WHAT I REALIZE MARNI IS THE WELL THE FIRST ONE HAS NUTS RAISINS AND M&MS AND THEY'RE JUST ALTOGETHER BUT THE NEXT ONE UM HAS THE PEANUTS SEPARATE THE RAISINS SEPARATE AND THE M&MS SEPARATE IT'S NOT A MIXTURE YET
WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT BASICALLY IT JUST DISSOLVES INTO ANOTHER ONE LIKE SUGAR AND TEA AND JUST BASICALLY YEAH THEY JUST DISSOLVE THEY'RE JUST THEY JUST DO I'M ACTUALLY NOT REALLY SURE WHY WHY THEY JUST DISSOLVE
WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
THE PEANUTS RAISINS AND CANDY ARE ALL GETTING SEPARATED INTO THEIR OWN PILES
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CHANGING TO DIFFERENT GROUPS
WELL THE RAISINS NUTS AND M&MS ARE BEING SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER AND NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
THEY'RE GETTING SEPARATED
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE THERE'S A SCREEN ON TOP OF THE BOWL AND WHEN YOU POUR THE MARBLES AND THE WATER ON IT IT SEPARATES THE TWO MIXTURES
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT MARNI
WHAT HAPPENS MARNI IS THAT THE SALT ALMOST TOTALLY DISINTEGRATES IN THE WATER AND THERE'S JUST IT JUST DISSOLVES IN THE WATER AND IT'S JUST CLEAR SO YEAH DEAL WITH IT MARNI
THE SOLUTION
SOLUTE
A MIXTURE IS LIKE CANDY MIXED WITH NUTS BUT A SOLUTION A SOLUTION HAS TWO THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE MIXED TOGETHER AND THEY JUST THEY CREATE A LIQUID OR
WELL THE MIXTURE OF THE SALAD RIGHT THERE IS A MIXTURE BETWEEN LIKE SALADS LIKE TOMATOES SALADS AND JUST ALL DIFFERENT STUFF AND THEN THAT LIKE CHECKS MIX I THINK IT IS TRAIL MIX UM IT IT IT'S A MIXTURE OF PEANUTS M&MS AND RAISINS AND THEN THE CUP WITH THE WOOD CHIPS AND PAPER CLIPS IS A MIXTURE TOO OF WOOD CHIPS AND PAPER CLIPS AND THE MARBLES AND WATER IS GOING TO BE
BYE MARNI I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU GOODBYE I'LL SEE YOU IN YOUR WORST NIGHTMARES
MIXTURES
THE SCREEN IS CATCHING THE SAND
THE SCREEN IS CATCHING THE MARBLES BUT SINCE THE HOLES ARE SMALLER THAN THE MARBLES THE MARBLES JUST STAY WHERE THEY ARE AND THE WATER GOES THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S SMALLER THAN THE HOLES
THE RESULT OF THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU POUR THE MIXTURES TOGETHER THEY'RE ONE MIXTURE AND THEN WHEN YOU POUR IT THROUGH THE SCREEN ALL THE SAND GETS CAUGHT TOGETHER AND THE WATER JUST GOES THROUGH THE FUNNEL
SOLUTIONS JUST CAN'T GET SEPARATED ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THIS ONE IS POWDER AND WHEN YOU STIR IT IT'LL JUST IT'LL JUST GO AWAY IT JUST DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
HOW I'M REALLY EXCITED TO LEARN WITH YOU MARTIE
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE SALT WILL JUST TOTALLY DISSOLVE IN THE WATER YOU JUST CAN'T SEE IT BUT IT'S STILL THERE AND THEN YOU KNOW THE ONE WITH THE PAPER CLIPS AND THE WOOD CHIPS UH YOU IT'S JUST IT'S LIKE IT'S JUST TOGETHER IT'S JUST A MIXTURE
I'M DOING GREAT MARNI HOW ARE YOU DOING
YOU USE SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA GET THE PAPER CLIPS OUT OF THE JAR UNLESS YOU HAND PICK THEM AND THAT WOULD TAKE A WHILE
THE APPROPRIATE THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY HERE IS THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIPS AND TAKING THEM OUT OF THE MIXTURE OF PAPER CLIPS SAND TOOTH PICKS AND ROCK
CAUSE NOT ALL ONES ARE GONNA WORK ON TO THIS
I NOTICED THAT THE MAGNET STILL WORKED ONTO THE PAPER CLIPS
WELL MARNI THERE IS A MIXTURE OF IT LOOKS LIKE SAND ROCKS AND PAPER CLIPS AND THE THE CHILD IS TRYING TO MAGNETIZE THE PAPER CLIPS ONTO THE MAGNET CAUSE IT'S MADE OF METAL
IT'S A MIXTURE MARNI
A SCREEN
THE PROPER PROPERTY IS THAT THE ROCKS ARE TOO BIG TO FIT THROUGH THE SCREEN BUT THE SMALLER PEBBLES AND WATER ARE SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT THROUGH THE SCREEN
PAPER CLIPS
SO THAT THE BIGGER ROCKS CAN BE SEPARATED FROM THE WATER AND THE PEBBLES THE SMALLER PEBBLES
EVAPORATION
WELL WE'RE JUST DOING A PROJECT ON SALT AND SEEING WHICH ONE WAS GONNA BE MOST THE MOST DENSE
WELL WE TALKED ABOUT THE MIXTURE BETWEEN THE MAGNET AND THE PAPER CLIPS AND ALSO WE DID THE SCREEN WITH THE PEBBLES WITH THE ROCKS
WELL MARNI YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM WITH A FAN SO THAT THEY WILL GET SEPARATED
OKAY
I REALIZED THAT THE PEBBLES GOT STUCK IN THE SCREEN
SO THAT IT WILL MAKE THE WATER CLEAR
THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS PEBBLES ARE GETTING STUCK IN THE FAN KAY MARNI
SAW WHAT HAPPENED WAS UM THAT THE LITTLE PEBBLES GOT STUCK IN THE FILTER
THE MAGNET IS MAGNETIZED TO THE PAPER CLIPS
WELL MARNI THE SAND IS SMALLER THAN THE ROCKS SO THE ROCKS DON'T GO THROUGH BUT THE WATER DOES
BYE
USE A SIEVE SO THAT IT WILL CATCH THE BIG PEBBLES
WELL IT'S A MIXTURE OF SAND ROCKS TOOTH PICKS AND PAPER CLIPS
IT'S TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT THE PEBBLES AREN'T BIG ENOUGH TO FIT THROUGH THE FAN
SO THAT IT WOULD (()) THE PAPER CLIPS
BECAUSE IT'S BIGGER THAN THE HOLES
THE SALT IS THE BEST ONE BECAUSE WHEN YOU POURED IT INTO THE DISH AND IT EVAPORATED OVER TIME YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT VERY CLEARLY BY THE NEXT DAY
ATTRACTORS
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
I THINK IT'S A SOLVENT
THE SOLVENT
THE SALT DISSOLVED AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE SALT IS A MIXTURE
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
WELL THE THE FIRST ONE WITH THE THE WATER AND THE SAND THAT MAKES THE WATER ALL LIKE MUDDY IS BECAUSE THE THE SAND IS PROBABLY MORE DENSE THAN THE SALT SO IT JUST MAKES IT MUDDIER AND THEN THE ON THE SECOND PICTURE THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER AND YEAH
IT PLAYS A SOLVENT OH YEAH OH YEAH OH YEAH OH YEAH
THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE GETS ALL LIKE CLOUDY AND ALSO IT JUST SINKS TO THE BOTTOM IT DOESN'T DISSOLVE LIKE THE SALT DOES BUT THE SALT TOTALLY DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
WELL THE SALT IS GETTING MIXED INTO THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVES INTO IT SO IT JUST LOOKS LIKE NORMAL WATER
A SOLUTION IS LIKE SOMETHING GETTING MIXED INTO WATER TO MAKE SOMETHING AND THEN A MIXTURE IS LIKE PAPER CLIPS AND WOOD CHIPS
A SOLUTION
SORRY MARNEY I HAVE TO GO OKAY I'LL SEE YOU LATER BYE
ONE WILL BE A DARKER PURPLE
WELL ONE HAS POWDER AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH POWDER
A SOLVENT
A MIXTURE
ADD MORE GRAPE FANTASTIC
WELL IT'S SHOWING THAT THE GRAPE FANTASTIC POWDER AND THE DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
IT HAS LESS POWDER
OH ADD MORE WATER
THE COLOR
REPEAT
SWEETER AND HEAVIER
MIXTURES AND SOLUTION
IT WOULD TASTE A LOT BETTER SWEETER AND GRAPE
IT HAS MORE POWDER
WELL ONE HAS FIVE SPOONFULS OF THE DRINK MIX AND THE OTHER ONE HAS ONE SPOONFUL OF THE DRINK MIX
WELL ONE IS GONNA BE DARKER THAN THE OTHER ONE
ONE HAS MORE
WELL YOU NEED TWO DIFFERENT RESOURCES
REPEAT
IT HAS MORE WATER
<NO_SIGNAL>
IT HAD MORE FLAVOR
WELL LESS WATER AND THREE SPOONFULS IS GONNA TASTE PRETTY BLAND BUT WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE FIFTEEN MILLILITERS OF WALER AND THREE SPOONFULS IT'S GONNA TASTE A LOT BETTER
MARNI I NEVER WANNA SEE YOU AGAIN OKAY BYE
REPEAT THE QUESTION
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
I DON'T KNOW
THE MOTOR AND THE SWITCH
THERE IS GOOD LITTLE HEXAGRAMS ARE LIKE ENERGY THEY HOLD ENERGY AND EACH ONE
THE FLAGS OUT ROLLING AND THERE IT'S AND THE MOTOR STARTS MOVING
ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE BATTERY
IT MAKES LEARN IT PUTS THE ENERGY IN THE PANEL AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND TO THE MOTOR
ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PANEL AND THE WIRES
THE FLAG IS MOVING
YOU TOO MARNIE SEE YOU LATER HAVE A GOOD DAY TOO BYE
THE MOTOR IS WORKING
MOVE
THE MOTOR MOVES IT ON
IT IS SHOWING CIRCUIT AND THE MOTOR AND BATTERY TO WIRES CONNECTING TO THE MOTOR AND THE BATTERY AND THE FLAG IS MOVING RUN THE MOTOR
NOTHING HAPPENING
GOOD
THE MOTORS ON
IT RUN NEXT TO THE WIRES AND THE METAL <BREATH>
IT SERVES ENERGY FOR THE PANEL
THEY SERVES THE ENERGY AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND TO THE AND MOTOR AND OUT AND BACKEND THE BATTERY
TO MAKE SURE THAT IS RUNNING AND THERE IS ON AND THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH
WHEN IT'S A CLOUDY DAY THE MOTOR STOPS RUNNING AND THEN WHEN IT QUICK AGAIN ON THE CLOUDY DAY IF THE MOTOR STOPS RUNNING
IT DOESN'T MOVE
THERE HAS TO BE TWO WIRES AND BATTERY OR THE MOTOR LIGHT BULB AND THE SWITCH WHEN THE WORK WITH METAL RIGHT THERE AND WHEN IT'S OFF YOU PUT IT TOGETHER AND THEN TURNS ON
WHEN I QUICKED AT IT MOVED AND THEN IT TURNED ON THE MOTOR
IT JUST THE TROPHY DOESN'T MOVE
ENERGY FROM THE SUN ARE A KIND OF LIKE ELECTRICITY
THE ENERGY IS COMING OUT OF THE MOTOR AND ENTER THE D-CELL
WELL IT'S NOT NEXT TO THE METAL IT'S OFF WHEN YOU PUT A ON THE METAL THAT'S ON
IT WILL SERVE ANY ENERGY
THE MOTOR IS ON AND THE BATTERY IS NOW RUNNING
THE WIRES THEY GO THROUGH LIKE A METAL SPRING AND IT JUST GOES THROUGH THE BATTERY AND OUT THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE MOTOR AND THAT MAKE IT WORK
<NO SIGNAL>
IT'S POPS
IT'S THE MOTOR
I WAS BUILDING A CIRCUIT STYLE
+UM+ THE SOLAR PANEL IS TO MAKE- IS CONNECTED THROUGH WIRES TO THE MOTOR AND IT ON A SUNDAY- AND IT'S ON A SUNNY DAY AND IT COLLECTS- THE SUN IS LIKE THE ENERGY FOR THE SUN IS THE PANEL SO IT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN
BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT IT’S THE METAL AND IT'S LIKE A ELECTRIC FIND TO THE WIRES
IT WON’T WORK
THE ENERGY IS COMING IN THE +UM+ THE PLASTIC AND IT'S SOUND ENERGY
IT WON'T WORK
THEY BOTH HAVE ENERGY AND +UM+ AND THEY BOTH SERVE ENERGY
I SEE A STICK THAT +UM+ KEEPS THE FIRE ON AND HELPS IT MELT
GAS WOOD WINDMILLS SOLAR PANELS
THERE'LL BE HEAT ENERGY
GOOD
WAX
I CAN SEE +UM+ FIRE THAT’S MAKING THE- WHAT IS IT- THAT'S MAKING THE CANDLE MELT AND IT'S MAKING THE CANDLE MELT SO NOW THE ENERGY IS GETTING STORED INTO THE CAN- (*) OF THE CANDLE AND INTO THE STICK AND THE FIRE GETS CLOSER AND IT MELTS
APPLES
BECAUSE THEY BOTH SERVE ENERGY
I SEE FIRE GOING ON A CANDLE
SOME ARE BATTERIES PHONES +UM+ ANY KIND OF METAL AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANY MORE
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON SCIENCE AND CIRCUITS STILL USING TWO BATTERIES AND USING- TRYING TO LIGHT UP TWO LIGHT BULBS ON ONE BATTERY
IT GETS- THE FIRE MAKES THE AIR HOT AND SMOKE COMES FILLS THE AIR
HEAT ENERGY
THE SOLAR PANEL
WE NEED IT SO LIKE WE HAVE LIGHT AND IT PROVIDE US WITH A LOT OF THINGS
THEY BOTH ARE FUEL
SOUND ENERGY
SOLAR PANEL GIVES ENERGY AND THE GAS DOESN’T
I COULDN’T HEAR ANYTHING
SHE'S EATING AN APPLE AND SHE IS WALK- SHE IS USING HER ENERGY BY WALKING UP A MOUNTAIN
I DON’T KNOW
THE CANDLE IS MELTING BECAUSE OF THE HEAT AND GEE IT’S MOVING AROUND AND MELTING
GOODBYE
LIGHT ENERGY AND HEAT ENERGY
BECAUSE THEY DON’T SERVE ENERGY THEY JUST GIVE OUT SMOKE AND THE GAS MAKES THE CAR MOVE
THE FUEL SOURCES ARE THE WOOD
THE FIRE
IT MAKES STUFF MOVE WHEN IT'S NOT MOVING LIKE WHEN YOU PUT A BATTERY AND SOME WIRES INTO THE MOTOR IT STARTS TO MOVE
I SEE A SOLAR PANEL APPLES WOOD A WINDMILL- A WINDMILL +UM+ GASOLINE AND COAL
THEY SERVE BAD SMELL AND PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO BREATHE
I SEE THAT THERE IS FOOD ENERGY THERE IS GOING TO BE FIRE- EVERYTHING ELSE IS FIRE AND YOU CAN JUST PICTURE IT- A FIRE ON EVERY SINGLE THING BUT THE APPLES
YOU CAN BUT SOMETIMES YOU DON’T
THE BATTERY IN THE <BREATH> THE MOTOR IS MOVING
+UM+ I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO SAY THAT
I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON STILL CIRCUITS AND I HAVE BEEN USING SOME STUFF TO SEE IT THE WATER IF THE STUFF WATER SOUNDS CIRCUITS
I THOUGHT THAT WILL WORK BUT
I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN DOING A LOT JUST BEING WORKING ON CIRCUITS
THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED TO A SPACE
IF IT'S METAL IT WON'T WORK WHEN IF THEY MELT IT IT'S METAL IT WILL WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL IT WONT WORK LIKE PLASTIC IT WON'T WORK
HAPPENED
THEY'RE- CONDUCTORS ARE A THING THAT IS METAL AND YOU CAN USE IT IN CIRCUITS AND
WHEN I CLICKED THEM THEY WENT TO THE CIRCUIT AND THEN THEY STARTED- THE MOTOR STARTED RUNNING
IT’S NOT METAL AND IT WON'T WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL
THE INSULATORS ARE JUST ANYTHING THAT’S NOT METAL
ELECTIRCITY +UM+ METAL STUFF
CONDUCTING MATERIALS ARE METAL AND THEY WORK ON CIRCUITS BUT INSULATOR MATERIALS ARE WOODEN STUFF LIKE THE SPONG AND THE ROCK AND THE S- STICK AND THE STRAW
IT'S PLASTIC SO IT WON'T WORK
THEY ALL METAL
THE WIRES THE D-CELL THE SWITCH AND SCREEN
ENERGY IS FLOWING <SILENCE>
THE MOTOR STOPS GOING
GOOD
I DID THE SCREEN AND THE SCREEN IS METAL SO THEY IT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN ON THE SWITCH ON THE WIRE
THERE IS WOOD RIGHT THERE AND WOOD IS NOT METAL SO THE WOOD IS NOT MOVING
I CAN’T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU
THE FILAMENT DIED <NO_ SIGNAL>
THE BA- THE BATTERY IS ABOUT TO DIE
+UH+ THE FILAMENT DIES IN THE WAY IN THE WAY
AND CAN DOESN’T
<BREATH> IT’S KIND OF LIKE A CIRCUIT
IT’S A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND NOW THE BATTERY THE FILAMENT ISN'T DYING
BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE TWO WIRES
WHICH STOPS WORKING
STRINGS A LIGHTS ORI DON’T REALLY KNOW
THE FILAMENT DIED ON THE BATTERY
SO WE WERE CONNECTED ON THE MINUS SIGN AND THEY WERE CONNECTED ON THE PLUS SIGN
BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS DYING
WE’VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND COMPLETE CIRCUITS IN CONDUCTS IN CIRCUITS AND MAGNET
<NO_ SIGNAL> A FILAMENT DYING ON THE BATTERY
WHAT HAPPENS IS THE FILAMENT BREAKS <LAUGH> AND THE AND THEN THE ELECTRICITY GOES GREY AND IT STOPS MOVE-
AND THEN COMBINED CIRCUIT
+UH+ BECAUSE IT’S STATS UP WORKING REALLY REALLY BRIGHT AND THEN IT’S THE-
IT’S A CIRCUIT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT ALL AND INCOMPLETE CIRCUIT
INCOMPLETE CIRCUITS AND (*) CIRCUITS AND I CAN’T REMEMBER THE REST
THAT MEANS YOUR BATTERY IS DEAD
<BREATH> WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ON MAGNETS
BECAUSE IT’ S NOT  A COMPLETE CIRCUIT IN THE +UM+ LIGHT BULB IS IN THERE
A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
I THINK IT BECAUSE IT’S METAL AND THE TWO WIRES ARE GOING HOW CAN I THINK CHOOSE THE SWITCH AND THE BATTERIES ARE CONNECTING TO THE THREE SWITCH THAT TO THE THREE WIRES AND ITS GOING TO THE +UM+ LIGHT BULB
IT’S AN INCOMPLETE CIRCUIT
THE BATTERY DIED
WIRES IN A BATTERY END DO YOU LIGHT BULB
<BREATH> BECAUSE IT’S LIKE A NORMAL CIRCUIT IT’S JUST WITH THE SWITCH IN THE LIGHT BULB WITH THE LEGO THING ON IT
REAL ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY DIED <NO_ SIGNAL> AND THEN THE CIRCUIT NO WIRES DIDN’T BRING ELECTRICITY THROUGH ONE AND THEN IT STARTED TO DIE
WELL-THE FILAMENT IS DYING
GOOD
I DO NOT KNOW
YES
COPPER
IT’S REPELLING
THEY’RE BOTH METAL
THEY BOTH STICK BECAUSE THEY’RE BOTH METAL AND ONE SIDE IS NORTH AND ONE SIDE IS SOUTH
COPPER
THE MAGNET IN THE NAIL STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY’RE BOTH METAL THEN WOOD ISN'T BECAUSE IT’S JUST
<BREATH> WOOD <NO_ SIGNAL> BRICK PLASTIC CARD BOARD +UM+ PAPER WOOD AND <NO_ SIGNAL>
IT DID STICK
I DON’T KNOW
<NO_ SIGNAL> THEY ATTRACT THINGS ON THE FRIDGE
THEY’RE ATTRACTING TO EACH OTHER <NO_ SIGNAL> HOW MANY SESSIONS ARE THERE <NO_ SIGNAL>
PLEASE DON’T
METAL COPPER STEEL AND <NO_ SIGNAL>
I SAW THAT ONLY A FEW THINGS THAT A METAL AND COPPER AND THIS PAPER FOLDER THING IS +AH+ OR METALS SO FROM THE
+UM+ IT THEY MOVES WHEN IT IF THEY REPELS LIKE A WILL NOT GO ON IN A MOVE AND IF A WON’T AND IF DOESN’T STICK IT WON’T GO
ONE OF THEM IS NOT METAL AND ONE IS SO
YOU CAN SEE COME THROUGH IN SOUTH TO SOUTH AND NORTH TO NORTH  SO THEY WERE NOT BE OPPOSITE SO THEY CAN STICK
TOMBSTONE
<BREATH> ANYTHING THAT IS METAL OR COPPER OR STEEL WILL FIT WILL FIT IN AND STICK
IT WILL STICK BECAUSE I HAVE TOMBS-
<NO_ SIGNAL> COPPER STEEL METAL +UM+ GOLD
NO <BREATH>
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
YES THEY HAVE LOT OF TIPS THAT-
STEEL NAIL COPPER NAIL <NO_ SIGNAL> AND A THAT’S IT
<NO_ SIGNAL>
<BREATH> WHERE STICK WHEN THEY ARE NOT ON THE SAME THINGS LIKE SOUTH IN SOUTH AND NORTH IN NORTH THEY CAN DO THE REST OF REPEL
I’VE BEEN DOING SOME +UM+ <SIDE_ SPEECH> NO MAGNETS
MAGNETS ARE A PEACE OF ROCK THAT IS REALLY SMOOTH AND YOU COULD MAKE IT INTO MAGNETS LIKE LIKE (*) MAGNET IN A U MAGNET IN A BRIDGE MAGNET
IT DOES STICK
THE NAIL IS STICKING TO THE STEEL NAIL AND ALUMINUM NAIL IS NOT BECAUSE IT’S NOT METAL
THAT WILL STICK
TOMBSTONE
BECAUSE STICKING ON EACH SIDE
<NO_ SIGNAL> ONE OF THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO A STEEL NAIL
NO MAGNET IS ATTRACT EACH OTHER PAPERCLIP
BECAUSE THE NAIL IS METAL AND THE WOOD IS NOT
STEEL
THE MAGNETS
THE LIGHT BULB IS MAKING- IS LIGHTING UP
BY SWITCHING THEM AROUND
BATTERIES
THE BULBS ARE STILL LIGHTING
THERE ARE THREE
(*)
GOOD
WHEN ONE OF THEM ARE FACING THE SAME WAY
ENERGY IS FLOWING
I SEE ONE LIGHT BULB ONE BATTERY MAKES THE TWO LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP AND TWO D-CELLS MAKES BOTH OF THEM
OH-IT GETS BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER
AND IF IT’S ONLY METAL IT'LL WORK LIKE A SWITCH ON THE CIRCUIT THAT WILL WORK
+HUH+
NOT A LOT
YOU CAN EASILY SEE THE ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND OUT AND BACK IN- IN THE WIRES AND INTO THE BATTER- AND THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN ON OUT AND THEN INTO ANOTHER LIGHT BULB AND OUT AND BACK IN THE BATTERY AND THAT'S JUST HOW THE WORKS
WIRES
THE BULBS GET LIGHTER LIKE +UM+ THEY GET REALLY BRIGHTER WHEN YOU PUT THE BATTERY- ANOTHER BATTERY NEXT TO ONE
BECAUSE IT’S IN THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY CAN- +UM+ PROVIDES ENERGY AND YOU PUT THEM TO THE- YOU PUT SOME WIRES NEXT TO BATTERIES AND LIGHT BULBS AND THE ENERGY STARTS MOVING AND IT COMES OUT OF THE BATTERY
WHEN I CLICKED ONE OF THE BATTERIES IT STARTED WORKING WHEN I CLICKED IT AGAIN THEY STOPPED WORKING
THEY BOTH- THEY- ONE GETS BRIGHTER AND ONE GETS DARKER
THEY'LL GET DARKER
MAKES THIS LIGHT UP
BECAUSE THE TWO BATTERIES ARE FACING THE SAME WAY
IT CAN USUALLY FLOW ANYWHERE JUST WHERE ENERGY IS TOUCHING OTHER METAL STUFF AND METAL STUFF
BYE MARNIE
<NO_SIGNAL>
THE BATTERY AND THE FILAMENTS IN THE LIGHT BULBS
THEY'RE JUST THE SAME
IT IS GOING COUNTER AND IT'S GOING CLOCKWISE AND IT'S GOING IN IT'S GOING IN THE WIRE AND IT'S SERVING INTO THE COMPUTER I MEAN THE LIGHT BULB AND IT'S MAKING IT'S WAY OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB AND INTO THE D-CELL AGAIN IT'S LIKE A CYCLE
CIRCUITS
A WIRE
THEY CONTROL THE USE AND THERE IS A BALL OF ENERGY ON IT SO WHEN YOU PLUG IT IN IT TURN SOMETHING ON
WHEN YOU MOVE THE LIGHT BULB FROM THE WIRE IT DOESN'T TURN ON BUT WHEN YOU MOVE BACK TO THE SAME PLACE WAS WHEN YOU TURNING ON IT'S WORKING
GOOD
IT IS BLOWING TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB SO IT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY LIGHT
<NO SIGNAL>
THE MINUS SIGN
THERE IS A LIGHT BULB AND IT <SILENCE> KNOW
THEY CARRY ENERGY THEY CARRY +UM+
OKAY ALL DONE
IT WOULDN'T STARTED IT WOULD JUST STOP
THEY- THEY BRING THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY UP TO THE OTHER- UP TO THE OTHER BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB SO IT LIGHTS UP
<SILENCE> THE ENERGY IS STOPS AND THE LIGHT BULB TURNS OFF WHEN YOU TURNED IT AROUND AND IT'S LIKE STRAIGHT UP IT THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING AND THE LIGHT BULBS STOPS GLOWING
IT MEANS THAT IT CONTROLS ALL OF THE ENERGY AND IT SERVES IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE AND UP IN THE BATTERY OR THE LIGHT BULB BATTERY USING
THE BATTERY
OKAY HAVE SOME FUN
EITHER WAY YOU QUICK ONE WIRE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB IT STILL TURNS ON
IT'S LIKE A BIG PIECE OF ENERGY THAT IT'S HIGH AND IT LIKE MAKES IT FLOW LIKE MOLECULES IT MAKES IT SHAKE IN IT MOVES ON INTO THE LIGHT BULB BATTERY IN IT IN THE BATTERY INTO THE WIRE AND IT KEEPS ON GOING <SILENCE>
IT TURNED AROUND AND NOW IT'S GOING IN FROM THE OTHERS SIDE THAT THE OTHER SIDE WAS GOING FROM THE MINUS SIGN AND NOW THE MINUS SIGN IS GOING UP AND THE PLUS SIGN IS GOING DOWN AND THE OTHER WIRE
IT FLOWS IN THE PLUS SIGN AND THEN IT GOES OUT OF THE MINUS SIGN
I DO NOT KNOW
THERE IS A BALL OF ENERGY AND IT JUST GET STUCK IN THERE AND IT LIKE RE-GENERATES AND THEN IT GO MAKES THE BIG WIRING GOES OUT AND THEN COMES BACK AND THEN GOES BACK IN
IT'S A IT'S JUST A USE OF ENERGY
I DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING  MORNIE
<BREATH> LIGHT BULB +UM+ WIRE AND A BATTERY
MOLECULES ARE ELECTRICITY BULBS LIKE LITTLE BULBS OF THE ELECTRICITY
THEY SERVE YOU LIGHT WHEN YOU HAVE ALL LIGHT
BYE MORNIE SEE YOU NEXT TIME
ELECTRICITY
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT STOPPED BUT IT JUST PROBABLY HOW THE BALL OF ENERGY IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LIGHT BULB SO IT ONLY BECAUSE UP INSTEAD OF DOWN
IT STOPS
THE MINUS SIGN
ENERGY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY IN THE LIGHT
IT
I SEE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULB
I JUST THINK OF IT LIKE MAGIC
NO MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO THE RIVET
+UH+
(*) I DON’T KNOW
YES
RIVET AND NAILS AND STUFF AND ELECTRICITY IN THE BATTERY IN THAT MAGNET
TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
<NO_ SIGNAL>
THEY BRINGS UP MAGNETS FROM ANYTHING METAL THAT IS RAPTURE AROUND UH HMM ANYTHING LIKE A STEEL RIVET OR A NAIL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
I NEED +UH+ WIRES A SWITCH SOME MAGNETS <NO_ SIGNAL> THREE  WIRES IN A BATTERY
ELECTRICITY IS MOVING
IT ALL STOPS AND THE BATTERY IS JUST GOES AND THE MAGNET STICKS TO THE RIVET
TURNS DOWN
ALL THE MAGNETS NEED TO BE ATTRACTING TO THE BATTERY IN THE WIRES
ELECTRICITY IT’S LIKE THE FORCE IT’S PULLING AT THE MAGNETS BUT THE RIVET
IT ALL STOPS AND IT ALSO FALL UNDER THE FALL
SWITCH
<SIDE SPEAKER> SILENCE
I DON’T KNOW
I SAW WHEN I TURNED THE SWITCH ON ALL ABOUT ALL THE MAGNETS WHEN ON
OPEN AND THEN CLOSED
NOTHING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT
THE SWITCH IS ON SO IT WILL WORK WHEN IT’S ON AND IF IT’S NOT OFF IF IT'S A NOT ON IT'S GOING TO DIE
GOOD
THE RIVET IS KIND OF LIKE A BATTERY BUT THE WIRES ARE COILED AROUND IT SO IT GOES A ABOUT THE MAGNETS AND IT STICKS ON THE ON THE RIVET
I DON’T KNOW
<NO_ SIGNAL> MAGNET THINGS
THE ELECTRIC MAGNET IS A BATTERY WITH ALL OF THAT THINGS AND THEN
THESE ARE +ER+ MAGNET THINGS
ATTRACTING IS WHERE ATTRACTING IS WHERE YOU +UM+ WHERE MAGNETS STICK TOGETHER AND RE- REPELLING IS WHERE MAGNETS ARE COMING TOGETHER
I SEE THE THE ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE WIRE AND THE SWITCH AND THEN INSERT THE COILED WIRE AND IT GOES IN A CIRCLE AND ITS MAKING THE ENERGY STICK TO THE WIRE TO THE MAGNET
I DON’T KNOW
UH HMM I OBSERVED THAT THE RIVETS STOPS FLOWING ENERGY END AND THEN THE CIRCUITS STOPPED GENERATE MAGNETS FLOW
THEY WORK AS A TEAM TO BUILT UP ALL ELECTRICITY AND MAKE THE MAGNETS COME UP
I NEED TO HAVE ALL THE SUPPLIES  I NEED TO MAKE A
I SAY THE ONE WITH THE FOUR WIRES IN THE ONE BATTERY
I SEE BATTERIES ON DIFFERENT SIDES
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON PARALLEL- PARALLEL CIRCUITS- I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON TWO PARALLEL LIGHT BULBS PARALLEL CIRCUITS +UM+ COMPLETE CIRCUITS INCOMPLETE CIRCUITS AND A LOT MORE
<SILENCE>
TWO OR THREE OR FOUR
+UM+ I DON’T REALLY KNOW ABOUT THAT
<BREATH> IT’S NOT REALLY A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
RIGHT NOW I SEE TWO WIRES TO ONE LIGHT BULB THAT IS IN THE BATTERY AND THE ENERGY IS GOING BACK IN THE BATTERY OUT THROUGH THE OTHER WIRE AND INTO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB THAT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP AND THEN IT GOES OUT THE OTHER ONE AND BACK IN THE LIGHT BULB
A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THE LIGHT BULB IS CONCERNING ENERGY
I SEE ENERGY MOVING REALLY FAST
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS
IT'S MOVING WAY FASTER
MORE THAN TWO BATTERIES
THEY'RE LIGHTING UP VERY BRIGHTLY BECAUSE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE FILAMENT
THE ENERGY WOULD JUST GO IN HALFWAY IN THE LIGHT BULB INTO ANOTHER WIRE OUT INTO ANOTHER LIGHT BULB INTO ANOTHER WIRE AND THEN IN THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP AND INTO THE BATTERY AND IT RESTARTS THAT
GOOD
+AH+
+UH+ I DON'T KNOW
I SEE THAT THE BATTERIES ARE TURNING THE +UM+ ARE NOT REALLY WORKING BECAUSE THEY'RE ALMOST DEAD AND THE BATTERY IS GOING OUT
<NO_ SIGNAL>
THAT’S ENERGY MOVING
IT’S FLOWING THROUGH EVERY WIRE AND INTO THE BATTERY AND OUT TO THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
<NO_SIGNAL>
+UM+ I DON'T REALLY KNOW
YEAH
OH I HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF STUFF ON MAGNETS
I SEE THE WIRE TURNING GREEN AND THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE BASE OF THE LIGHT BULB IN THE FILAMENT AND OUT OF THE WIRE ON THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB AND INTO THE PLUS SIGN ON THE BATTERY IN OUT AND IT WENT- GOES OUT AND BACK IN ANOTHER LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT GOES BACK IN THE PLUS SIGN IN THE D-CELL
THE WIRES THEY'RE MAKING THEM GO THROUGH THE BATTERIES- I MEAN THE LIGHT BULBS AND INTO THE BATTERY
<NO _SIGNAL> THE FIRST ONE
<SIDE_SPEECH>
MOVE AWAY
YES
<NOISE>
THE YELLOW BALL CAN NOT REFLECT UHM CAN NOT REFLECT YELLOW LIGHT AND ABSORB ALL THE OTHER COLORS BECAUSE THE FILTER ALREADY ABSORBED ALL THE COLORS INCLUDING YELLOW
UHM BECAUSE UH THE GREEN LIGHT THE GREEN FILTER IS ALREADY ABSORBED ALL THE COLORS EXCEPT FOR GREEN SO THE GREEN LIME CAN REFLECT THE GREEN LIGHT
I THINK THE BLUE BALL IS IS ONLY REFLECTING THE BLUE AND IS NOT REFLECTING THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
THE RAY HITTING THE BALL IS WHITE AND THE RAYS COMING OFF THE BALL ARE BLUE
WHEN THE LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE BLUE BALL THE LIGHT BECOMES BLUE
I THINK THAT WHEN YOU SHINE THE RED LIGHT ON IT IT WILL TURN BLACK BECAUSE THE RED ALREADY ABSORBED ALL THE COLORS INCLUDING THE GREEN
ONLY THE RED LIGHT CAN MAKE THE BRICK APPEAR RED BECAUSE THE RED FILTER ON THE LIGHT UHM ARE ABSORB ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW EXCEPT FOR RED AND THAT MADE IT SO THE RED BRICK CAN REFLECT THE RED
THE UH LIGHT INCLUDING GREEN AND ALL THE OTHER COLORS EXCEPT FOR THE RED AND BLUE ARE ABSORBED AND SO THE GREEN LIME CAN NOT REFLECT THE GREEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT THERE
THE BALL IS REFLECTING ONLY THE YELLOW LIGHT INSTEAD OF BLUE LIGHT
THE RED IS ABSORBING LIGHT BUT THE BUT IT IS ABSORBING THE LIGHT THAT IS NOT RED BUT THE LIGHT PASSES THROUGH IT AS WELL
<SILENCE>
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW WE SEE THINGS BY LIKE BEING REFLECTED OFF THEM
THE RED SHEET IS ABSORBING ALL OF THE COLORS EXCEPT FOR THE RED AND THE RED IS BEING TRANSFERRED ONTO THE OBJECT BEHIND IT
EVERYWHERE
THEY ARE ALL WHITE LIGHTS
THE LIGHT IS SHINING THROUGH THE PRISM AND THEN THE PRISM SEPARATES ALL THE COLORS THAT IS IN THE LIGHT
I THINK IT GETS ABSORBED EXCEPT FOR THE BLUE WHICH IS AND THE BLUE LIGHT IS REFLECTED OFF THE BALL
A LIGHT BULB THE SUN AND A CANDLE
I THINK THAT THE REST OF THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW ARE BEING ABSORBED BY THE BLUE BALL AND ONLY THE BLUE IS BEING REFLECTED
IT'S WHITE
THE OBJECTS APPEAR TO BE RED BECAUSE THE LIGHT THEY ARE REFLECTING IS RED
I'M FINE
IT TURNS GREEN BECAUSE YELLOW AND BLUE MIXED TOGETHER IS GREEN
RED
I THINK THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT BEHIND THE FILTER WOULD CHANGE
THE LIGHT IS HITTING THE BALL AND THEN THE
WHITE
WHEN THE LIGHT WHITE LIGHT HITS THE GLASS TRIANGLE IT GETS CUT UP INTO ALL THE DIFFERENT COLORS OF THE RAINBOW
I THINK THAT THE OTHER COLORS OF THE RAINBOW ARE BEING ABSORBED BY THE BLUE BALL
THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
UHM THE BULB THAT IS NOT BURNED OUT HAS ITS OWN PATH TO THE D CELL SO IT DOESN'T GO OUT
THE ONES BEHIND IT BURNED OUT
THE OTHER BULB BURNS OUT TOO
THE OTHER BULB KEEPS ON GOING
IT IS UH THE SAME IS A SIMPLE CIRCUIT EXCEPT REPEATED SO IF ONE IF THE BULBS GO OUT THE OTHERS WON'T UHM GO OUT
THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT CLOSED
WHEN THE CIRCUIT
SINCE IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT UH WHEN ONE BULB BURNS OUT THE OTHER ONE CAN NOT WORK AND SO BECAUSE THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
THEY THEY GO OUT TOO BECAUSE THE CIRCUIT IS NOT COMPLETE
HUNGRY
<SILENCE>
WHEN ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS GOES OUT THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T GO OUT BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE HAS ITS OWN PATH TO THE D CELL
IT LIGHT
THE OTHER BULBS KEEP ON GOING BECAUSE THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE A SIMPLE CIRCUIT WITH THE WAY THEY'RE CONNECTED
HOW THEY LIGHT BULBS SHARE THE SAME ELECTRICITY SO UHM IF ONE LIGHT BULB IS OUT
UHM UH THE LIGHT BULB WILL BURN OUT AND SO THE CIRCUIT IS NOT COMPLETE AND THE OTHER ONE DOES NOT WORK
THE OTHER BULB WILL KEEP ON GLOWING BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME IT'S THE SAME UH IT HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY TO THE BATTERY AND IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME AS A SIMPLE CIRCUIT
UH IT'S IT'S A UH UH A A SERIES CIRCUIT
PARALLEL
THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN SO THE OTHER ONE DOES NOT WORK
<SILENCE>
THE CIRCUIT NOT COMPLETE
I'M GOOD
REFLECTION
THE LIGHT RAYS ARE BOUNCING OFF EVERYTHING AND UHM AND UH AWAY
IT REFLECTS AT AN ANGLE
WHEN THE LIGHT UHM HITS THE WATER IT GETS BENDED AND THEN IT COMES OUT OF THE WATER AND GETS BENDED AGAIN AND THE LIGHT BOUNCING OFF THE PENCIL MAKES IT LOOK LIKE THE PENCIL IS BROKEN
UHM THE PERSON IS TURNING ON THE LIGHT WHICH IS MAKING IT EASIER TO SEE THINGS
THE LIGHT BULB IS MAKING LIGHT WHICH IS GOING INTO THE BOYS EYES WHICH MAKES HIM SEE IT SEE
THE LIGHT EVENTUALLY HITS THE FIRST STAR BY BOUNCING OFF ALL THE MIRRORS
THE LIGHT TRAVELS IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND THEN IT BOUNCES OFF AN OBJECT AND THAT'S WHY WE SEE THE OBJECT
YES
THE LIGHT BEHIND THE THE LIGHT BEHIND THE PERSON IS MAKING HIS
WE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE SEE THINGS BY LIGHT BEING REFLECTED OFF THEM AND HOW LIGHT CAN BE REFRACTED WHEN IT GOES THROUGH A DIFFERENT TRANSPARENT SURFACE
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS SPLIT IN THE MIDDLE
I THINK LIGHT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
THE LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF THOSE THINGS AND UHM WE SEE THE LIGHT WHICH MAKES US SEE THOSE THINGS
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT REFLECTS OFF OF THINGS AND HOW LIGHT PASSES THROUGH SOME THINGS
THE LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF OF HIM ONTO THE MIRROR AND THEN BACK TO HIM
THE FLASHLIGHT IS MAKING LIGHT WHICH REFLECTS OFF THE FIRST MIRROR THEN THE LIGHT THAT REFLECTS OFF THE FIRST MIRROR REFLECTS OFF THE SECOND MIRROR AND THEN THAT LIGHT REFLECTS ONTO THE STAR AND THE STAR REFLECTS IT SO WE CAN SEE
WE CAN ONLY SEE THINGS BECAUSE LIGHT IS BOUNCING OFF THEM
THE LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE MIRROR AND HITS THE OTHER MIRROR THEN THE LIGHT HITS THE STAR
LIGHT EITHER BOUNCES OFF THE OBJECT GOES THROUGH THE OBJECT OR GOES THROUGH THE OBJECT
THE LIGHT IS NOT HITTING IS A DIFFERENT SURFACE WHEN IT GOES THROUGH THE GLASS WITH JUST AIR IN IT BUT THE LIGHT IS HITTING IS GOING THROUGH A DIFFERENT SURFACE WHEN IT GOES THROUGH THE WATER
THE MIRROR IS BEING USED TO MOVE THE LIGHT AT AN ANGLE SO IT HITS THE WALL
YOU CAN SEE THINGS BECAUSE LIGHT BOUNCE OFF OF THEM AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T SEE THINGS LIKE GLASS BECAUSE LIGHT GOES THROUGH IT
PLANETS ARE ROTATING AROUND THE SUN
I HAVE LOOKED AT SOME OF THEM AND SOME OF THEM HAVE MORE MOONS THAN THE OTHERS AND SOME OF THEM ARE BIGGER AND WIDER THAN THE INNER PLANETS THAN THE OUTER THE OUTER PLANETS ARE BIGGER THAN THE INNER PLANETS SO THEN IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT AND SATURN HAS UHM IN THE UHM IT HAS RINGS AROUND IT
THE EARTH ROTATING IN A CIRCLE AND WE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE SUNS GRAVITY WE WOULD JUST SHOOT IN A
THAT INNER PLANETS ARE SUPER SMALL
THE OUTER PLANETS ARE UHM UH GASSY GAS GIANTS BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OUT OF GAS AND THEY ARE WAY BIGGER THAN OUR PLANETS CLOSER TO THE
TERRESTRIAL PLANETS AND ALSO THE INNER PLANETS
SO FOR HOW LIKE
BECAUSE IT'S SHOWING US WHAT IT IS MADE OUT OF AND IT'S SHOWING US THE SUN AND THE SOLAR FLARE
IT'S UHM ALL THE PLANETS ARE ORBITING OUR SUN
THE STRING BROKE
GOOD
UHM OUR OUR UHM OUR EARTH AND ALL THE OTHER PLANETS ROTATING AROUND THE SUN SHOWING THE YEARS THAT HAVE PAST IN THOSE DAYS
THE WHEN YOU HOVER OVER THE PLANETS PAST YOU SEE THE GRAVITY AND IT'S PAST IF YOU IF YOU CLICK ON THE SUN YOU WILL SEE HOW IT WILL ROTATE AND IF YOU UHM HAVE THE SUN HAVE THE SUN REMOVED IT WILL GO IN A STRAIGHT LINE
SOLUTE IS THE SALT AND IT DISSOLVES INTO THE
YEAH
I NOTICE THAT THE WATER DISSOLVED INTO WATER VAPOR AND LEFT THE SOLUTE BEHIND IN THE
WHAT DID YOU SAY
OKAY
IF THERE'S NO WATER WHEN THE WHEN THE WATER TURNS INTO THE WATER VAPOR IT'S NOT IN THE CONTAINER ANYMORE SO THE ONLY THING LEFT IN THE CONTAINER IS THE SALT
WHAT DID YOU SAY
THE
FIRST TO THE PERSON WEIGHED THE AMOUNT OF WATER
WE SEE THAT IT DOESN'T LOSE ANY WEIGHT IT JUST ADD
I NOTICE THAT IF YOU ADD THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER AND THE OTHER THING YOU GET THE AMOUNT OF YOU GET THE WEIGHT OF THE OTHER OF THE
THE WATER IS PLAYING THE PART OF DISSOLVING THE GRAPE (())
I THINK IT MEANS THAT IT IS A
I DON'T KNOW
I THINK THAT THIS IS A
A SOLUTION
WHAT DID YOU SAY
YES
A MIXTURE
I THINK IT MEANS THAT THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
YOU'RE MIXING IT LIKE WITH WHAT THE SOLUTE TO MAKE A SOLUTION
IT TELLS YOU THAT THE MASS OF THE STUFF THAT YOU MIX DOESN'T CHANGE
I NOTICE THAT THE SALT CAUGHT IN THE COFFEE
I NOTICE THAT IF YOU ADD THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER AND THE WEIGHT OF THE SALT YOU'D GET THE WEIGHT OF THE SOLUTION IN THE END
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CLOCK IS TO SHOW THAT IT TAKES A LONG
HEAT
WHAT
THE SOLVENT IS THE WATER AND IT LETS AND
EVAPORATING
I NOTICE THAT THE CITRIC ACID DID NOT GET CAUGHT IN THE FILTER
UM YOU SEE THAT THE SALT EVEN THOUGH IT DISAPPEARS IT DOESN'T LOSE ANY WEIGHT SO THAT MAKES IT SO THAT IF YOU ADD THE WEIGHT OF THE SOLVENT AND THE SOLUTE YOU'LL GET THE WEIGHT OF THE MIXTURE
I NOTICE THAT IF YOU ADD UP THE GRAM I NOTICE THAT IF YOU ADD UP THE WEIGHT OF THE THREE THAT MAKE UP THE MIXTURE YOU GET THE WEIGHT OF THE MIXTURE
I THINK THE POINT THAT THIS PICTURE IS TRYING TO MAKE IS IF YOU ADD A LIQUID TO A SOLUTE YOU'D GET A SOLUTION
A SOLUTION
THE WATER IS TURNING INTO WATER VAPOR
EVAPORATE THE WATER
YOU COULD USE A FILTER TO GET THE SOLUTE OUT
OKAY
I THINK THAT THIS IS A
THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER BUT EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T SEE IT IT'S STILL THERE SO IT DOESN'T LOSE ANY WEIGHT
THE SOLVENT
THE
THE ROCK IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN THE FEATHER
OKAY
THE WATER
THAT I THINK THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATE
I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
I'VE LEARNED THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WAS HEAVIER THAT MEANS THAT MY PREDICTION WAS RIGHT
I THINK THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE
I THINK THAT THE MASS AND THE AMOUNT OF THE DISSOLVED SOLUTE ARE RELATED BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF SOLUTE WELL THE MORE SOLUTE THE MORE MASS THE SOLUTION HAS
I DON'T KNOW
THE SOLUTIONS HAS DIFFERENT MASSES BECAUSE ONE OF THEM HAS TWICE AS MUCH SOLUTE AS THE
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE GRAPE SOLUTION ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE GRAPE SOLUTION ON THE LEFT SIDE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
IT MEANS BYE
YEAH
I CAN TELL THAT SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST
WE COULD WEIGH THEM
I NOTICE THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT

MEANS THAT THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED
THE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO WEIGH THE SAME
I FIGURED IT OUT BY TAKING THE SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS AND SUBTRACTING FIFTY GRAMS FROM AND GETTING SEVENTEEN GRAMS
THIS MEANS THAT THE SALT IN THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SEVENTEEN GRAMS

SOME OF THE EPSOM SALTS ARE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTAINER
FIFTY MILLILITERS OF SALT SOLUTION IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER THEREFORE IT WEIGHED

THEY'RE BEING DETACHED FROM EACH OTHER FR- BY THE WASHERS
NO
YES I CAN READ THE LABEL
YES
CHIPS IT TAKES TO SEE IF WHEN
WASHERS IS TAKES TO BREAK THE FORCE
RIGHT AND OK
THANKS
WHEN YOU PRESS THE ORANGE WASHER THE ONE WASHER JUST SEPARATES THE TWO MAGNETS
YES THAT WAS HAPPENING TO THE MAGNETS
OK
WHEN THE MAGNETS DON'T STICK TOGETHER ANYMORE
YES WE DID AND WE DID THE GRAPHS WITH STICKERS
I'M GOOD
THAT IT'S TAKING THAT MANY WASHERS HOW MANY ARE IN THE CUP TO UNHOOK THE MAGNETS
THEY'RE BEING DETRACTED AND
WHAT WAS UH WE TOOK UM ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE AND WE UM UM MEASURED THE SAME THING AND WE DID THE SAME THING WITH THAT AND WE CUT IT THE SAME LENGTH AS THAT AND THEN WE WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE OFFICE WITH THAT AND WE TRIED TO SEE HOW MANY PACES IT WAS <BREATH> AND OUR GROUP CAME UP WITH ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NI- EIGHT <BREATH> BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT WAS VERY CORRECT
MAYBE IF WE SAID IF <FP> FROM THE THE VERY START OF OUR ROOM TO THE UM UH THE DOOR TO THE OFFICE THEN THAT WOULD BE I THINK YEAH HOW WE WERE YEAH
ESTIMATE YEAH
WELL IT IT ACTUALLY KNOWS HOW MANY INCHES IT IS AND IT TELLS YOU HOW MANY INCHES IT IS OR FEET IF WE'RE USING FEET SO OR METERS <LAUGH> SO IT'S A LOT
I HAVE NO CLUE <LAUGH> I'M SAYING THAT TO MOST QUESTIONS BUT YEAH <BREATH>
OKAY GOOD <LAUGH> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO MOST QUESTIONS
WELL THE METER TAPE IS ONE METER <LAUGH> UM AND MY ESTIMATE WOULD PROBABLY BE FROM OUR CLASSROOM TO THE UM OFFICE WOULD PROBABLY BE UH
UM EH THEY'RE NOT THAT ACCURATE I AND WE TRIED THE STRAWS ONCE WE MEASURED OUR DESK WITH STRAWS AND I DON'T THINK THAT WAS VERY ACCURATE EITHER YEAH
THE STANDARD IS SOME IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE AGREES ON YEAH
ESTIMATING IS ANOTHER WORD FOR GUESS
NO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW NO
UM WE'VE DONE A *LOT* OF A LOT OF *ESTIMATES* WHAT WE'VE DONE IS UM WE HAD THE SHEET OF PAPER AND IT SAID ESTIMATE AND THEN ACTUAL AND UM <FP> THERE WAS WE HAD TO FIND LIKE FROM MY DESK TO THE UM BOOKSHELF I GUESSED IT WOULD BE PROBABLY SIX PACES AND <FP> IT WAS REALLY EIGHT SO THAT WAS WHAT WE DID WITH ESTIMATES SO FAR
IT SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE UH YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TRY OVER AGAIN INSTEAD OF JUST THINKING AND MEASURE IT TWICE
UM WELL CAUSE SOMETIMES IF YOU MEASURE IT LIKE WHEN WE WERE DOING THE UM THE PACES WITH THE TAPE THAT WASN'T VERY UM EASY CAUSE IT WAS PAINFUL AND LONG AND UM UH IT WAS CONFUSINGLY WEIRD THAT'S JUST <BREATH> DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE <BREATH>
YEAH WHAT WE DID WAS UM WE HAD A REALLY LONG SHEET OF PAPER LIKE WHAT WE USED AND UM WE DID A NORMAL PACE AND UM RIGHT THERE WE STOPPED AND WE HAD A PARTNER AND WE WERE MEASURING TOE TO TOE SO UM RIGHT AFTER THAT UM WE MADE MARKS ON OUR ON BOTH OF OUR TOES AND WE CUT WHERE THE BOTH OF THE MARKS WERE AND THAT'S HOW WE KNEW WHERE HOW OUR PACE WAS SO UM IT WAS REALLY SMALL IT WAS LIKE THIS BIG SO YEAH
MAYBE CAUSE THE METER IS UM LIKE UH
YEAH SMALLER OBJECTS
YEAH NO WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT UM I HAVE NO CLUE NO IDEA NO
YEAH BUT WE DIDN'T COLOR EM YET NO
UH I DON'T KNOW KNOW REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS CALLED BUT YEAH AND UM UM N NO WHAT WE DID WAS WE TOOK ANOTHER SHEET OF PAPER THAT WAS THE SAME AS WE USED FOR OUR PACES AND <BREATH> WE UM TOOK IT UP TO HERS AND WE CUT IT AND MADE IT THE SAME LENGTH AS HERS AND THEN WE UM WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE OFFICE WITH IT AND SEE HOW MANY PACES IT WAS OF THEM BUT I DON'T THINK IT WAS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT IT WAS WELL UH THAT'S A LOT OF PACES AND <LAUGH> I TRIED THAT ONCE AND IT WAS ONLY THIRTY EIGHT PACES AND <BREATH> YEAH <BREATH> YEAH
UM YES WE AS WE PRACTICED DOING ESTIMATES THEY GOT A LOT BETTER YEAH
UM I'VE LEARNED THAT UH
UM WELL WE'VE BEEN MEASURING OUR PACES AND YESTERDAY WE KIND OF LIKE UH THERE WAS SOMEONE'S PACE AND WE AND WE PUT IT ON THE UH A TAPE P PIECE OF PAPER THING AND THEN WE UM
I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS CALLED IT WAS THIS SKINNY KIND OF PIECE OF PAPER AND IT WAS IN LIKE A LITTLE TUBE THING SHAPE <BREATH> <FP> AND THAT'S WHAT IT WAS I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS CALLED AT ALL SO
YEAH YEAH
UM ESTIMATE IS UM ANOTHER WORD FOR GUESS AND UM <BREATH> UH IT'S SOMETHING IT CAN'T BE LIKE FROM THE OFFICE TO THE ROOM WOULD BE ONE METER THAT'S NOT A VERY ACCURATE UM
UM I DON'T REMEMBER THAT NO NO NOT REALLY WE DID UM WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT THE STANDARDS YESTERDAY ON OUR IN OUR MATH NOTEBOOKS BUT <BREATH> NO NOT REALLY
I HAVE NO IDEA <LAUGH>
TWENTY EIGHT METERS MAYBE I DON'T KNOW I HAVE NO CLUE <BREATH> MAYBE JUST MAYBE <BREATH>
LIKE I SAID EARLIER WE SHOULD ALWAYS MEASURE TWICE CAUSE IT MIGHT NOT BE RIGHT CAUSE THE FIRST TIME IT WAS LIKE THIS BIG AND THEN THE SECOND TIME IT WAS LIKE THIS BIG SO <BREATH> IT WAS A LOT EASIER TO DO THAT SO
PROBABLY NOT
YEAH REPEATING THINGS IS BETTER THAN JUST DOING THINGS ONCE <BREATH> AND I'VE HEARD THAT ON SHOWS ALWAYS MEASURE TWICE YEAH
MAYBE WE DIDN'T CUT *ACCURATELY* OR UM WHEN WE WERE DOING THE TURNS UH THAT MIGHT'VE BEEN WRONG WHAT WE DID WAS WE TOOK THE MEASURING TAPE AND WE PUT OUR FINGER AT THE END OF IT AND THEN PUT OUR THE TAPE RIGHT NEXT TO IT AGAIN SO <BREATH> YEAH AND IT WAS A LITTLE CONFUSING AND I DON'T THINK IT WAS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PACES <BREATH>
UM LIKE OUR METER TAPE OR UM IF IT'S SOMETHING SMALL WE COULD USE A RULER LIKE THOSE MEASURING TOOLS YOU KNOW SO
UM WELL WHAT WE DID WAS LIKE WE LIKE I SAID WE TOOK THE TAPE MEASURE THING AND WE MEASURED THE THE ONE PACE THAT A GIRL TOOK AND THEN WE UM WE TOOK A P A LONG SHEET OF PAPER I FORGOT WHAT IT'S CALLED UH <BREATH> NO IT WASN'T THAT
UM YEAH BUT LIKE I SAID UM WE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT MORE FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE OFFICE SO YEAH
<BREATH> WELL IF YOU THINK HOW IF YOU WALK DOWN TO THE OFFICE BEFORE AND LIKE YOU FOR NO REASON COUNTED YOUR STEPS OR SOMETHING AND YOU KNEW HOW MANY PACES WERE IN A METER OR SOMETHING THEN <BREATH> MAYBE UM YOU CAN UM MAKE A MORE ACCURATE GUESS BY THE STEPS THAT YOU'VE T TAKEN TO THE OFFICE FROM THE ROOM
OKAY YEAH
UM NO I DON'T WE DIDN'T MEASURE IT WITH A METER TAPE WE MEASURED IT WITH UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT IT'S <BREATH> <FP> IT'S SOME KIND OF TAPE AND WOW UH <LAUGH> IT WAS LIKE
UM CAUSE UH WHAT WE DID WAS WE ESTIMATE A LOT OF STUFF AND IF WE MAKE AN ACCURATE ESTIMATE THEN AND IT'S NOT RIGHT THEN YOU SHOULD STILL TRY OVER AGAIN AND SEE IF IT WAS RIGHT CAUSE UM WHEN WE WERE MEASURING OUR PACES MINE WAS REALLY SMALL AND I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS IT WOULD BE THAT SMALL SO I I MEASURED IT TWICE I MEASURED IT OVER AGAIN
YEAH JUST THIRTY EIGHT PACES WHEN I WALKED OVER THERE YEAH <LAUGH>
UM NO I DON'T BELIEVE SO I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE
UM WE WERE STUDYING UH BONES AND UH THE YUTES ARAPAHOE AND CHEYENNE BASICALLY SO WE WERE DOING THE BONES WITH MISSES WAGNER AND THE YUTES CHEYENNE AND UM ARAPAHO INDIANS WITH MISSES HILL SO YEAH UM WE'RE JUST STARTING THAT SO YEAH YEAH UH WE CUT OUT LIKE THIS TAPE THINGIE I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS CALLED AGAIN I FORGOT WHAT IT WAS UH
UM YEAH WE ALL H WE EACH HAD UM FOUR STRAWS AT OUR TABLE AND I HAD WE EACH GOT ONE STRAW AND UH YEAH SO <BREATH> UM SOME OF US DID SOME OF US DIDN'T UH WE BASICALLY ALL DID SO YEAH
UM I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES THAT MISS HILL WAS TALKING ABOUT SOME THINGS ABOUT THE CENTIMETERS BUT I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT SHE WAS SAYING CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE MAYBE IT WAS MISS WAGNER WHEN WE WERE RIGHT AFTER WE CUT EM OUT I DON'T KNOW BUT I THINK YEAH YEP
IT WAS LIKE THREE AND A HALF STRAWS BUT WE ONLY HAD ONE STRAW TO MEASURE WITH SO <BREATH> WE LIKE USED OUR FINGER TO HOLD OUR SPOT AND THEN PUT THE STRAW RIGHT BY OUR FINGER AGAIN SO <BREATH> YEAH
IT WAS KIND OF COMPLICATED I DIDN'T GET IT REALLY I DIDN'T GET IT ALL
NO NOT REALLY
YEAH I THINK SO
UH NOT REALLY NO
NO
YES WE MEASURED OUR DESKS WITH STRAWS
THING ELSE
UM NO I DON'T REMEMBER US USING THE CENTIMETERS TO MEASURE ANYTHING YET BUT <BREATH> YEAH
YEAH <LAUGH> YEAH YEAH LIKE WOULDN'T BE STRAWS IF THEY WERE BENT JUST A SLIGHTLY BIT AND DIDN'T NOTICE SOMETHING YEAH
CAN I TAKE THESE OFF OKAY
OH NOT YET NO I DON'T REMEMBER THAT ANYTHING
<FP> YEAH <BREATH>
NO NOT YET NO NOT YET
UM WELL WE GLUED THEM TOGETHER AND WE CUT THEM OUT BUT WE DIDN'T COLOR THEM YET OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT <BREATH> UM I THINK THEY WERE FOR MEASURING CENTIMETERS NOT INCHES
UM WE BASICALLY ALL GOT THE SAME RESULTS SOME OF THE DESKS ARE HIGHER BUT THAT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER
UH WE GLUED THEM TOGETHER YEAH YEAH UM
NO NOT YET WE DIDN'T COLOR EM IN YET NO
<BREATH> UM WELL CENTIMETERS ARE USED AROUND THE WORLD AND WE'RE LIKE THE ONLY PLACE THAT USES INCHES <BREATH> AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LEARN HOW TO USE CENTIMETERS TOO SO IF WE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE THEN WE KNOW HOW TO MEASURE THINGS JUST YEAH
UH YEAH YEAH
OKAY OKAY
JUST SO THEY WOULD STAY TOGETHER BUT THEY HAD TO BE GLUED IN A CERTAIN ORDER WHICH WAS KIND OF WEIRD I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY HAD TO BE GLUED AND LIKE THEY WENT FROM ONE TO A HUNDRED SO THEY WERE LIKE A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS ON THERE OR SOMETHING SO YEAH
UM THEY ARE PRETTY USEFUL BUT THEY CAN'T BE USEFUL FOR EVERY SINGLE THING CAUSE
UH WE ONLY MADE ONE PER STUDENT SO YEAH EVERYONE ELSE HAD ONE
<LAUGH> UM WELL IF IT'S A BIGGER PAPER CLIP IT WEIGHS MORE LIKE METAL AND PLASTIC METAL WEIGHS MORE <BREATH> AND IF IT'S SMALL THEN IT DOESN'T WEIGH AS MUCH SO IT'S EASY TO TELL WHICH COULD WEIGH MORE
YEAH
I E WAS MOST SURPRISED THAT I THI I FIGURED OUT THAT THEY WEREN'T ALL THE SAME SIZE SO THAT'S WHY WE DIDN'T COME UP WITH THE SAME ANSWERS
YEAH
HELLO <LAUGH>
NO IT'S NOT TELLING YOU HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS BUT IT'S TELLING YOU WHICH THING IS HEAVIER
THANK YOU
I THINK THAT WOULD BE EFFICIENT IF WE ALL GOT THE SAME PIECE BUT IF WE DIDN'T THEN LIKE LE LIKE I SAID WITH THE PAPER CLIPS IT WOULDN'T BE EFFICIENT <BREATH> YEAH
<BREATH> YEAH BUT WE PUT THOSE IN THE <FP> THE SCALE YEAH THE SCALE YEAH
WELL IF THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE THEN IT IT WILL WEIGH THE S IT'LL WEIGH THE SAME THING AND THEN I IF IT'S NOT THE SAME SIZE THEN THEY WEIGH DIFFERENCE IT'LL BE A DIFFERENCE THERE
THOSE MIGHT BE BIG THOSE ARE E LITTLE
OH SORRY UH
YEAH
MMM NO METER YEAH YEAH
UH LIKE SAY IF WE'RE DOING GROCERY BAGS WITH <FP> UH I DON'T KNOW EGG CARTONS OR SOMETHING IN THERE <BREATH> THEN UM SOME OF THOSE ARE BIGGER AND SMALLER LIKE THE PAPER CLIPS SO THAT WOULDN'T BE EFFICIENT EITHER NO SO SOME THINGS AREN'T EFFICIENT AND SOME THINGS ARE YOU HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING THAT'S ALWAYS THE SAME SIZE
YEAH
YEAH
N MMM NO NOT YET <BREATH> YEAH
WELL IF IT'S NOT IF IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME KINDA MATERIAL THEN SOMETHING HAS TO BE HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER THING AND METAL IS LIKE UH YOU COULD BLA- YOU COULD BREAK PLASTIC IF YOU COULD LIKE BEND IT BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY BEND METAL IF IT'S REALLY STRONG METAL AND WASHERS ARE UM WELL MY GRANDPA HE HAS THIS JUNKYARD IN HIS BACKYARD AND UM I ALWAYS FIND UM WASHERS OUT THERE CAUSE HE HAS A LOT OF EM WASHERS AND UM THEN I HA I HAVE THIS GAME THIS HAS PLASTIC CHIPS WHEN IT KIND OF LIKE FLIES OUT OF THE CONTAINER THING <BREATH> AND UM IT WOULDN'T THE PLASTIC THING ONCE HIT A TREE AND IT LIKE TRI IT BENT AND YEAH YEAH UM METAL FEELS HEAVIER THAN THE PLASTIC YEAH YOU'RE ABLE TO VIEW IT LIKE YOU'RE A SCALE AND YOUR BODY
UM CAUSE THEN SHE TAUGHT US THAT SOME THINGS AREN'T THE SAME SIZE SO WE HAD WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH OUR WHEN WE'RE MEASURING
WELL THEN YOU CAN SHOW EACH OTHER WHAT YOUR PAPER CLI- CLIP LOOKED LIKE AND THEN YOU COULD SAY OH WELL YOURS IS BIGGER THAN MINE THAT EXPLAINS HOW WHY YOURS WAS TWO AND MINE WAS FOUR
UM WELL THE OTHER DAY WE DIDN'T GET TO FINISH THIS BUT WE WERE LIKE MEASURING THE THERE WAS LIKE A WASHER AND A BLOCK OF WOOD IT WASN'T REALLY WOOD IT WAS CARDBOARD AND A PLASTIC CHIP AND WE WERE MEASURING WITH PAPER CLIPS AND MISS WAGNER SNUCK IN A TRICK WHICH WAS UM THE PAPER CLIPS OKAY <LAUGH> UH WELL THERE WAS LIKE THIS SCALE THAT WE USED UH AND WE PUT PLASTIC CUPS IN THEM AND
NO DIDN'T GET TO THAT YEAH
WE SHOULD ALL USE THE SAME SIZE PAPER CLIPS
UM THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME LIKE THEY'RE BOTH EVEN THEY'RE ON THE SAME <BREATH> HEIGHT YEAH LEVEL UM
YEAH
THEY COULD JUST GO COMPLETELY BLANK AND YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THE ACTUAL RESULT THE ANSWER
OKAY THIS ONE OH SORRY
I THINK THE METAL WOULD GO DOWN AND THE PLASTIC WOULD GO UP
YEAH
I THINK YOU'RE THINKING OF THE GRAM YEAH WELL WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T USE THOSE CAUSE IT WAS WE WERE OUT OF TIME SO UM A GRAM IS SMALLER THAN PAPER CLIPS AND SOME OF THEM ARE ALL THE SAME SIZE AND SOME OF THEM ARE BIGGER THAN EACH OTHER SO THOSE MIGHT NOT BE EFFICIENT EITHER
YEAH
WELL IT'S UH IT'S CONFUSING IT'S WEIRD UH <BREATH> UH HOW SHOULD I HOW SHOULD I SAY THIS IT UH
<BREATH> WELL THAT MEANS IT'S HEAVIER CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING IN THE OTHER CONTAINER THING AND THEN UM THAT RIGHT THERE UH UH THE PLASTIC CHIP WAS IN THERE AND IT WAS HEAVIER THAN JUST NOTHING AT ALL SO WHAT WE DID IS WE PUT UM THE THE PAPER CLIPS IN ONE BY ONE UNTIL IT WAS EXACTLY LEVEL WITH THE PLASTIC CHIP YES
ONE GRAM EQUALS ONE GRAM
UM WE COULD GO AND BUY THE SAME KIND OF PAPER CLIP THAT ARE THE SAME UH WHAT DO YOU CALL IT UH THE SAME SIZE <BREATH> THE SAME SIZE AND UM THEN MAYBE YOU CAN REMEASURE AND MAYBE IT'LL BOTH BE FOUR OR BOTH BE TWO <BREATH>
YEAH
PROBABLY A GRAM CAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE THE SAME SIZE
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TRUST EITHER OF THEM UM
THAT WOULD BE FIVE PAPER CLIPS <BREATH>
NO THE PAPER CLIPS WERE DIFFERENT SIZES SO IF THEY WERE REALLY SMALL THEN THEY THERE WERE IF A THEY WERE REALLY SMALL THEN UM IF THEY WERE REALLY SMALL <LAUGH> THEN IT TAKES MORE TO MEASURE THE ACTUAL CHIP PLASTIC CHIP THING <BREATH> AND IF THEY'RE REALLY BIG THEN IT TAKES LESS
YEAH
NO
I THINK ALL OF US WOULD WEIGH IT WITH DIFFERENT PAPER CLIPS AND WE'D SEE WHICH ONE WOULD BE LIKE THE MOST EFFICIENT
THEN WE COUNT HOW MANY WE PUT IN AND IT SAYS FOUR <LAUGH> UM <LAUGH> AND THAT'S HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WEIGHS THE PLASTIC CHIP
I THINK THE UH THE WOOD THING THE WOOD CHIP IS MEASURE UM MEASURING MORE PAPER CLIPS AND UM THERE'S MORE PAPER CLIPS FOR THE WOOD CHIPS SO IT MUST BE HEAVIER SO
WELL METAL IS USUALLY MORE HEAV- HEAVIER THAN PLASTIC SO CAUSE <FP> PLASTIC ISN'T MADE OF THAT MUCH MATERIAL AND METAL IS MADE OF MORE STEELISH THINGS <BREATH>
UM WELL WE DIDN'T HOLD THEM FIRST MISS WAGNER UM PUT THEM IN THE CUP I THINK I FORGOT <BREATH> <FP> UM WELL WE WERE MEASURING WITH PAPER CLIPS AND WE PUT THE PLASTIC CHIP IN FIRST AND WE DIDN'T GET TO THE WASHER AND THE BLOCK OF CARDBOARD UM AND THEN WE PUT UM PAPER CLIPS IN UNTIL IT WAS EXACTLY LEVEL
LIKE FIVE GROUPS OF TWO HUNDRED
SEEING HOW MANY THERE ARE
I THINK WHAT THAT WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT IS YOU'RE ESTIMATING HOW MUCH THE PENDULUM WILL WILL SWING AND I THINK THIS GRAPH IS ALL ABOUT YOU CAN MEASURE THE THINGS YOU CAN SEE HOW YOU'LL MAKE THE PENDULUM
YOU CAN USE THE GRAPH WHEN YOU ARE MAKING A TEST YOU CAN DO IT BY YOURSELF UM YOU CAN DRAW THE NUMBERS AND THAT WOULD HELP YOU BETTER
HOW HOW THE PENDULUM CAN SWING IN FIFTEEN SECONDS
I THINK IT IS ALL ABOUT NUMBERING THE THE GRAPH NUMBERING THE WHAT YOUR ANSWER IS AND I THINK THIS HELPS BETTER THE GRAPH THE NUMBERS HELP BETTER THAN THAN THAN THE LITTLE BOXES
IT'S GOING VERY WELL
I THINK UM IT EFFECTS IT BY MAKING IT LONGER OR SHORTER BECAUSE IF YOU MAKE IT SHORTER I THINK IT'LL GO FASTER BUT IF YOU MAKE IT LONGER I THINK IT WILL GO SHORTER
WHEN YOU MAKE AN ESTIMATE I THINK YOU MAY GET IT RIGHT BUT MAYBE YOU WON'T BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW AND YOU HAVEN'T TESTED IT SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK AND WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO DO PENDULUM SOME PEOPLE JUST GUESSED AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN GET BY TO THAT
YES IT DOES
ABOUT
YES
THE FIRST LINE IS A UM
THE GRAPH IS ABOUT YOU HAVE TO MEASURE YOU HAVE TO PUT HOW MANY FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE TO PUT THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND NINETY TIMES AND YOU HAVE TO DO LIKE YOU CAN PUT TWENTY ALL THE WAY TO TO EIGHTY AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE GRAPH IS ALL ABOUT
WHAT MAKES IT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT EACH PENDULUM IS MADE OUT OF THE SAME THING AND WE'RE BASICALLY FROM WHAT I CAN SEE ONLY CHANGING THE LENGTH OF THE STRING
UM WELL TO REALLY LIKE CONTROL LIKE A THE STRING ON EACH PART WELL YOU COULD MAKE IT LIKE SHORTER OR LONGER OR LIKE USE A DIFFERENT MATERIAL THAT'S LIKE I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT I THINK SO THAT'S WHAT
THAT'S WHAT I THINK
WE CHANGED ONE THING AT A TIME TO SEE IF IT DID ANYTHING DIFFERENT
I HAVE BEEN SEEING UM IF WE CHANGE EACH THING ONE AT A TIME TO SEE IF A PENDULUM WILL SWING FASTER
THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME
FROM WHAT I CAN SEE I THINK THE VARIABLE THAT'S BEING TESTED IS UM HOW MANY SWINGS IT MAKES IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND UM HOW FAST IT'S GOING
I'M GOOD THANK YOU FOR ASKING
IT IS IMPORTANT TO CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T AND THERE HAPPENS TO BE A BIG CHANGE YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH THING MADE THAT THING HAPPENED SO YOU JUST NEED TO CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME TO SEE IF IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE
I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE LITTLE DOTS TO WHERE THE PENDULUM'S LENGTH MAY BE MARKED AND HOW LONG IT IS OR HOW MANY SWINGS IT TOOK <BREATH>
IT'S GOING REALLY WELL
UM THE NUMBERING SYSTEM I THINK WOULD JUST BE THERE SO YOU WOULD KNOW WHERE WHERE IT ACTUALLY MARKED UP TO AND IT WOULD HELP YOU SO YOU JUST KNOW WHERE TO GO OR LIKE HOW TO DO IT OR LIKE WHERE THE PENDULUM UM DATA WOULD GO
UM I'VE KEPT SEEING HOW MANY TIMES THE PENDULUM CAN SWING IN FIFTEEN SECONDS AND SO FAR IT KEEPS BEING AT LEAST TWELVE OR TEN
WELL THEY MARK THE GRAPH AND JUST MEASURE IT I GUESS AND
I THINK THE X AXIS IS ABOUT UM THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM AND WHERE IT WOULD MARK TO ON THE Y AXIS AND UM THAT'S WHAT I THINK IT'S ABOUT
WHEN YOU INCREASE THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM STRING UM I'VE NOTICED THAT IT GETS SHORTER AND SHORTER OF AND THE AMOUNT OF SWINGS LIKE FOR TWO HUNDRED IT ONLY GOT LIKE
IT'S ABOUT UM GRAPHING HOW MANY SWINGS THE PENDULUM MAKES AND UM THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM AND WHERE IT MARKS UP TO IT THAT'S WHAT I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT
<BREATH> DO YOU MEAN THE THE BOTTOM DOT OR THE HIGHEST DOT
<BREATH> THE NUMBERS ARE THERE TO TELL YOU HOW MANY SWINGS THERE ARE AND DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH YOU KNOW HOW MANY SWINGS ARE SO YOU'D MARK WHERE THE SWING IS AND IF IT'S NOT EXACT IT'S OKAY
I THAT'S ACTUALLY THAT'S ALL I HAVE SAY
ON ONE HUNDRED TWENTY AND LENGTH OF STRING AND ON THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IT HAD SEVEN SWINGS AND IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IT'S BECAUSE UM THE STRING'S PRETTY LONG
<BREATH> UM THE NUMBERS ARE THERE AND UM THE NAME WHERE IT IS LIKE THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM
OKAY OOPS SO WHAT IF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY IS SEVEN ONE HUNDRED FORTY IS A BIT BIGGER SO I THINK IT WOULD MAKE MAY BE FIVE OR FOUR BEC BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO LONG AND THERE'S SO MUCH WEIGHT AND SO I THINK IT WON'T GO FAST ENOUGH AND IT WOULD ONLY GET LIKE FIVE OR FOUR SWINGS
I THINK PREDICTING ON A GRAPH IS ALL ABOUT LIKE <BREATH> THINKING ON WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN OR WHAT CHANGES IT MIGHT MAKE DEPENDING LIKE ON THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM OR HOW MANY SWINGS OR WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHANGE
<BREATH> WELL IT'S MARKED AT THE TWENTY AND IT'S A LITTLE FARTHER OUT BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY ON THE TWENTY HERE AND THE LENGTH OF THE STRING MIGHT HAVE BEEN TWENTY CENTIMETERS AND SO UM MAY BE THAT'S HOW MANY SWINGS THE PENDULUM TOOK AND THAT'S HOW LONG THE PENDULUM WAS
WELL SINCE NINETEEN CENTIMETERS IS OH NINETY SORRY <BREATH> NINETY CENTIMETERS UM FOR THE NUMBER OF SWINGS FOR A PENDULUM I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A BIT LITTLE MAY BE LIKE MAY BE SIX OR SEVEN IT'S BECAUSE THE LENGTH OF THE STRING IS VERY LONG AND I THINK IT WOULD BE JUST KIND OF INTERESTING I GUESS
MY CHART WASN'T LIKE THAT WELL IT WAS KIND OF LIKE THAT BUT EXCEPT THE BOX ON TOP WE USED JUST MOSTLY THAT AND WE DIDN'T AND WE DIDN'T REALLY USE A GRAPH
IT CAN FIGURE OUT THAT UM FROM THE CAPACITY IT'S SAYING KIND OF LIKE LIKE HOW BIG IT IS AND THEN THE PASSENGERS HOW MANY IT TAKES WITH EACH SIZE OF BOAT LIKE EIGHTY CAN CARRY UM MAYBE FORTY FIVE PASSENGERS AND I NOTICED THAT THE SMALLER THE BOAT GETS THE LESS PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD
IT'S GOING VERY WELL THANKS
UM IT'S GOING WELL
BYE
UM WE DIDN'T EXACTLY MAKE A GRAPH YET WE BASICALLY JUST MADE A T CHART TO SEE LIKE UM HOW BIG THE BOATS ARE UM HOW MANY PASSENGERS DO YOU THINK WOULD BE ABLE TO FIT IN THERE LIKE WHAT OTHER WHAT OTHER
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT I DON'T THINK I KNOW UM WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ONLY WORD I REALLY KNOW IN THERE IS VARIABLE AND IT MEANS CHANGE ONE THING
IT ATTRACTS TO THE EARTH’S NORTH POLE
THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH IF THEY’RE TOGETHER THEN THEY ATTRACT FOR IF THERE NORTH AND NORTH OR SOUTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY WORK TO ACTUALLY GO TOGETHER THEY’LL PUSH EACH OTHER AWAY
I’M GOOD
REPEAT THAT PLEASE
BECAUSE THE SAME SIDE OPPOSITES ATTRACTS THE SAME ONES REPEL
THEY WOULD STOP ATTRACTING THEY WOULD REPEL
SHE IS USING COMPASS TO SEE WHICH WAY SHE IS GOING AND RIGHT NOW SHE IS GOING NORTH
MAGNETS
TWO MAGNETS ARE STUCK TOGETHER AND REST OF THE MAGNETS WELL ARE REPELLING ON TOP ON AND THEY’RE FLOATING BECAUSE THEY WON’T GO ON TO THE OTHER MAGNET
THAT THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH SIDE THEY BOTH <DISTURBANCE> CAN’T SEE THAT FACING THE SAME WAY LIKE THE SOUTH IS FACING RIGHT LEFT RIGHT NOW AND THE NORTH IS FACING RIGHT AND BOTH OF THE MAGNETS THAT ARE ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER
FLOWING THE MAGNETIC OF THE NORTH TO THE SOUTH
THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EVEN WHEN YOU PUSH IT’S BECAUSE IT’S WORK THROUGH THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT JUST WON’T GO TOGETHER
<NO_SIGNAL>
THE NAIL IS MUCH LONGER AND ITS AND THE MAGNET IS PERMANENT MAGNET THE NAIL IS A TEMPORARY MAGNET
THEY ARE HAVE TO HAVE TOUCHED EACH OTHER ONES
IT’S TOO- IT’S TOO FAR
GOOD
A TEMPORARY MAGNET IS WHEN THE WHEN THE MAGNET IS ACTUALLY CONNECTED TO THE NAIL WHEN IT’S NOT CONNECTED TO THE NAIL THEN IT’S NOT GOING TO STICK TO THE PAPERCLIP
+UM+ SO IT’S BECAUSE THE MAGNETISM GOES THROUGH THE SCREW AND THEN IT ATTRACTS THE PAPERCLIP
THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE BIG STEEL SCREW AND IT’S ALSO GIVING THE MAGNETISM THAT ATTRACTS THE PAPERCLIP
WE’VE BEEN LEARNING WHAT STICKS THE MAGNETS AND WHAT HAPPEN WHEN THEY INTERACT
MAGNETISM IS A CERTAIN RANGE OF HOW JUST HOW FAR LIKE THE IT IS LIKE WHAT MAKES THE PAPERCLIP STICK AND HOW THAT WORKS IS THAT THIS MAGNETIC FIELD ON THE MAGNET AND IRON IS ATTRACTED TO
BECAUSE IT’S NOT MAGNETIZED THE ALL TIME
IT’S A TEMPORARY MAGNET
IT’S AN- IT’S ATTRACTED TO
IT’S PICKING UP THE PAPERCLIP WITH ITS MAGNETISM
THEY USE MAGNETISM TO ATTRACT TO THE IRON AND TO OTHER AND THE- FOR THE
THEY’RE ATTRACTING EACH OTHER THROUGH THE TABLE
IT’S MAGNETISM
THE MAGNETISM IS GOING THROUGH THE NAIL AND WHERE IT COMES OFF THE NAIL STOPS BEING A MAGNET
THE NAIL IS MADE OF IRON AND DOING THE MAGNET ATTRACTS THE IRON NAIL THE IRON NAIL ACTUALLY IT IS ALSO NAIL A MAGNET AND IT WILL ATTRACTS LIKE PAPERCLIPS AND OTHER METAL OBJECT- OTHER STEEL OR METAL OBJECT OR IRON OBJECTS
AS YOU TAKE THE MAGNET OFF OF THE STEEL NAIL IT GOES AWAY BUT WHEN YOU PUT IT THE MAGNET BACK ON YEAH- YEAH WHEN YOU PUT IT BACK ON IT BECOMES MAGNETISED THEN IT ALSO MAKES WHENEVER IT PICKS UP MAGNETISE TOO
YOU ARE WHEN YOU TAKE THE MAGNET OFF ITS STOPS SPINNING RIGHT THERE AND THE PAPERCLIP ALSO BECOMES A MAGNET FROM THE NAIL
THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH OBJECTS
MAGNETISM ONLY TO A CERTAIN RANGE SO IF IT’S BEYOND THE RANGE THEN THEY WON’T STICK
TAKE THE- YOU TAKE THE MAGNET OFF
USING MAGNET
IT TRAVELS THROUGH IRON/SLASH STEEL OBJECTS
HELLO GOOD
THE ELECTRICITY GETS TO THE BULBS IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER BUT IN A PARALLEL IT <INDISCERNIBLE> COMES FROM THE BATTERY
IT’S STILL WORKS BECAUSE THE OTHER BULB HAS ITS PATH I DON’T AND ITS WHAT- IT’S WORKING BECAUSE WHEN ONE BULB GOES OUT THE OTHER STAYS ON
THIS IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT
THESE ARE ALL PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND THEN GIVING IN A LINE AND TO IF ONE GOES OUT THEN THE REST OF THEM STAY THERE
THE ELECTRICITY
THE SERIES CIRCUIT TRANSFERS ENERGY FROM ONE BULB TO THE OTHER BULB FROM THE BATTERY SO IF ONE IS GONE THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB CAN’T GET ITS ENERGY SO IT GOES OUT ALSO
CIRCUITS AND IF A BULB DOES HAVE TO HOLD LIKE AS A THE WHOLE THING BECAUSE WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHICH BULB WAS THE ONE THAT WENT OUT AND THE ONE THAT’S BURNT OUT THAT’S NOT GOOD
THE PARALLEL
<NO_SIGNAL>
THE OTHER BULB STAYS ON AND THAT ONES THE ANY ONE THAT BURNS OUT UNLESS ANY OTHERS BURN OUT
BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE BULBS THROUGH THE OTHER BULB AND WHEN THE FILAMENT BREAKS THAT CAN’T TRANSFER THE ENERGY TO THE OTHER ONE SO THEY GET SO THE POWER IS DONE
BECAUSE THE WIRE IS COMING FROM THE PATH IS IT’S COMING FROM THE BULB THAT’S SPREADING OUT AND IF NEGATIVE SIDE GOES THROUGH THE ONE THAT’S WORKING AND GOES THROUGH THE LITTLE EXTRA WIRE THAT WOULD BE LIKE THE POSITIVE SIDE TO THAT BULB AND IF THE POSITIVE SIDE ISN’T WORKING THEN THE BULB DON’T WORK
THE SWITCH IS OPEN
THEY GIVE IT OUT THE ELECTRICITY THAT A NEED
IT’S THE- THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY GOES TO THE BATTERY AND TO THE BACK FROM THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB BACK TO THE BATTERY FOR ALL THREE OF THEM INTO THE FILAMENT BRAKES AND THEN THE THEN THE ELECTRICITY STOPS FLOWING TO THE ONE THAT BROKE
A PARALLEL A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THE WHOLE STRINGS BURNOUT DEPENDING ON WHAT IT’S
IT’S BOTH THE CIRCUIT WITH LIGHTING THE BULBS WITH THIS IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
IT’S STOP
+AH+ THEY NORMALLY USE A CHRISTMAS TO DECORATE CHRISTMAS TREES AND HOUSES
THE OTHER BULB GOES OUT
THE OTHER BULB BURNS OUT ALSO
A CLOSED CIRCUIT
THE FLOW STOPS IN THE FILAMENT- IN THE FILAMENT IN THE BULB WITH THE FILAMENT BROKEN
FILAMENT IS BROKEN ON THE ONE ON THE LEFT AND THE ONE AT THE RIGHT IT’S FINE
THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY IS AN EVEN
GOOD BYE
THE BULB WENT OUT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN THE REST OF THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
A MAGNET
EASY FOR MAGNETS TO ATTRACT THROUGH
ADD MORE SPACERS
IT MAKES THE MAGNETIC POLE WEAKER
IT'S TOO WEAK SO EVEN ONE WASHER CAN JUST BREAK THE FORCE
IT GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND FINALLY IT BREAKS
MAGNETISM
SEEING HOW STRONG THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY ADDING ANOTHER ONE
I'M DONE
MAKES IT WEAKER BECAUSE THEY’RE FARTHER AWAY
MAKES IT HARDER TO GET THAT THE MAGNETISM IS WEAKER QUICK THROUGH THE THROUGH THE SPACERS
THE MAGNET CAN’T ATTRACT THE MAGNET CAN’T ATTRACT THE PAPERCLIP TO SUCH THICK STACK
DECREASES IT
<NO_SIGNAL>
YOU CAN ADD SPACERS
FORCE
ADDITIONALLY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WASHERS THAT CAN BE PUT IN BEFORE THE MAGNETISM BREAKS BECAUSE IT’S TOO STRONG IT HAVE A WEIGHT ON THE OTHER
MAGNETS AND IT’S HOW STRONG THERE
THE <INDISCERNIBLE> OF MAGNETISM
THEY’RE MUCH WEAKER THAN THEY MIGHT HAVE
WASHERS
ONLY STEEL AND IRON STICK TO MAGNETS WHILE OTHERS DO NOT
BECAUSE METALS AND IT HAVE METALS IN A ROCK LIKE IRON STICK STEEL AND THEN THE OTHERS THAT ARE SOMETIMES IF THEY’RE METAL THEY DON’T ACTUALLY STICK TO THE MAGNETS SO NOT EVERYTHING STICKS
THE STEELS SCREWS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THE WOODBLOCK ISN’T EVEN MOVING
THEY’RE MADE OF STEEL
IT CREATES A MAGNETIC FORCE THAT PULLS IT TO THE MAGNET
ONE IS MADE OF TIN AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS MADE OF STEEL
THEY ATTRACTS METALS
THE FAN IN THE REFRIGERATOR ARE BOTH MADE OF IRON OR STEEL AND ALSO THEY BOTH THEY BOTH ARE THERE ARE FLATTISH ARE FLAT ENOUGH OF THE SURFACE SO IT STICKS
WE’VE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS
THE IRON IT’S MADE OF IRON AND STEEL
IT’S STICKS BECAUSE IS MADE OF
THE NAIL STICKS TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE IT’S MADE OF IRON AND WOODBLOCK DOES NOT HAVE ANY IRON OR STEEL IN IT SO IT DOESN’T STICK
THERE IS IRON AND STEEL IS MADE OF IRON JUST REINFORCED
IT HAS STEEL AND THE WOOD BLOCK HAS
IT’S MADE OF STEEL
THE STEEL WELL THE IRON AND STEEL STICK TO THEIR
ONLY THE STEEL AND IRON THINGS ARE STICKING TO THE MAGNET
STEEL
WOOD YARN COPPER AND SOME OTHER KINDS OF METALS
GOOD
EVEN LIKE ONLY IRON AND STEELS SO IF THESE ARE LIKE COPPER THAT WON’T STICK AND ALSO IF IT’S NOT EVEN A CONDUCTOR FOR ACTUALLY ELECTRICITY THAT IT WON’T STICK AT ALL
WELL THEY DON’T STICK MAGNETS DON’T HAVE IRON OR STEEL
THEY ONLY ATTRACT IRON OR OTHER THINGS MADE OF IRON
IT HAS TRACES OF IRON
IF THE BLACK ROCK STICKS THE GREY THE BROWN GREY ROCK DIDN’T I THOUGHT YOU MEANT THE BLACK ROCK
IT WON’T STICK IT HAS IT TRACES LIKE IRON
IT’S REAL BECAUSE IT’S MADE OF IRON OR STEEL- STEEL PAPERCLIP
IF THE SWITCH ISN’T CONNECTED THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW AND IT CAN'T BECOME A MAGNET
WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN IT STARTS
SWITCH CONTROLS THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
IT MAKES STRONGER ELECTRIC FLOW TO THE RIVET
ELECTRICITY IN MAGNETISM ONLY GOES AROUND IRON AND STEEL
THE ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELING AROUND THE <INDISCERNIBLE> IT’S LIKE AND IT GOES INTO THE OTHER WIRES
THE ELECTRICITY STOPS IT STARTS STICKING ELECTRIC ELECTRIFIED AND THE MAGNETISM DISAPPEARS
A CLOSED SWITCH MIGHT BE ELECTRIFIED MAY BE A MAGNIFIED
IT'S ELECTRIFIED BY THE WHEN IT'S YEAH- ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH IT IT MAKES THE MAGENT FOR THOSE LITTLE WASHERS
OKAY ELECTRIFIED SCREW TO MAKE IT MAGNETISM AND YOU’VE ASKED ME LIKE THIS A HUNDRED TIMES
HOW MANY TIMES YOU WRAPPED AROUND THE WIRE BECAUSE THAT THAT DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY GO A LITTLE STRONGER OR WEAKER
A CLOSED CIRCUIT
IF YOU TURN IT OFF THEN THAT IT WON'T ATTRACT ANY WASHER
IF YOU MAGNETIZING THE STEEL SCREW IT WILL BECOME MAGNETIZE SO IT CAN PICK UP OTHER STUFF WITH THE STEEL SCREW SAME THING WITH RIVET IF THE RIVET IS STEEL AND YOU CAN ALSO PICK UP THE WASHERS WITH IT WHEN IT’S WHEN IT’S ELECTRIFIED AND MAGNETIZED
IT LET’S THE ELECTRIC FLOW GO TO THE METAL THROUGH THE WIRE AND SO MORE YOU WRAP IT AROUND THE STRONGER IS THE MAGNETISM GETS
WHEN ITS ELECTRIC IT HAS ELECTRIC CURRENT RUNNING THROUGH IT GET MAGNETIZED SO WHEN THERE IS NO ELECTRIC CURRENT IT BECOMES UNMAGNETIZED
THERE’S A D-CELL THE STEEL WASHERS A SWITCH IS A RIVET AND THE WIRES AND THEN THERE'S THE CIRCUIT BOARD
BECOMES MAGNETIZED
IF THE ELECTRICITY ISN’T FLOWING IT DOESN'T MAGNETIZE THE SCREWS SO IT DOESN'T PICK UP ANY WASHERS
WE MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET
A TEMPORARY MAGNETS ARE MAGNETS THAT ARE ALWAYS MAGNET YOU CAN  MAKE- THAT YOU CAN MAKE THEM JUST BECOME NORMAL LIKE METAL
AN ELECTRO MAGNET MAGNETIZES THE WASHERS AND THE SWITCH OPENS AND CLOSES TURN IT ON AND OFF
THE CIRCUIT IS JUST THE SAME WITH LIKE POWERING A MOTOR SO IT HAS TO BE FLOWN FROM THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE
<NO_SIGNAL>
IT BECOMES A MAGNET A TEMPORARY MAGNET
ITS MAGNETIZING THAT THE STEEL WASHERS
THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOING THROUGH IT'S AND THEN THE <INDISCERNIBLE> STUFF INTO THE POSITIVE AND ITS GOES BACKS TO THE BATTERY
IT MAGNITUDE UP TO THE RIVET
IF IT IT HAS TO BE FACED
(()) OPEN
THE SOLAR CELL IS GATHERING THE SUNS ENERGY AND CONVERTING IT INTO ELECTRICITY TO TURN THE MOTOR
WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING NEW BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CIRCUITS AND AND UM WHAT THE FLOW OF ENERGY
STOPS
THE MOTOR GOES WHEN IT'S CLOSED BUT AS SOON AS IT OPENS UP IT STOPS
IT HAS TO BE FULLY
THIS IS A SWITCH UM IT
UM IT THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH IT MAKING THE MOTOR SPIN AND THEN OF COURSE THE EXTRA ENERGY GOES INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE LIKE WE LEARNED ABOUT YESTERDAY
IT IT HAS THE ENERGY GO INTO THE MOTOR AND THEN IT TURNS THE LITTLE METAL PART AND THEN THE LITTLE FLAG IS ATTACHED TO THE END SO IT'LL TURN THE FLAG
ELECTRICITY IS TRAVELLING THROUGH IT AND BACK
THEY CAN WORK THE SUNS ENERGY INTO ELECTRICITY THAT YOU CAN
THE MOTOR GETS ELECTRICITY
THE ENERGY DOESN'T GET ALL THE WAY AROUND IT TO THE
THE MOTOR STARTS TURNING BECAUSE THE SUN IS THE SUNS ENERGY IS GOING ON TO THE SOLAR PANEL
IT STOPS TURNING
SO NO ENERGY IS FLOWING
THERE MUST BE A FULL CIRCUIT FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND BACK TO THE BATTERY OR ELSE THE ENERGY DOES NOT FLOW ALL THE WAY
THE BATTERY IS POWERING THE MOTOR SO THE LITTLE FLAG IS SPINNING AND THEN THE THE ENERGY FROM THE THE EXTRA ENERGY IS GOING BACK THROUGH INTO THE BATTERY
THE CIRCUIT HAS TO CLOSE
MAYBE IF IF IF SUN IS SHOWING THROUGH THE CLOUDS BUT IF NOT NO
THE SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE IN THE SUN
IT'S SHOWING THAT THE CIRCUIT IS GOING FROM THE NEGATIVE END OF THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR IT'S MAKING THE MOTOR SPIN AND THEN THE EXTRA ENERGY IS GOING BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
NOT WHERE IT WOULD NOT TURN THE SUNS
GOODBYE
IF THEY WERE INSULATORS THEY WILL NOT LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW
THERE IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT BUT IT’S BEING CLOSED BY A SCREW
THE PAPERCLIP IS COMPLETING THE CIRCUIT
IT IS NOT MADE OF METAL AND ITS MADE OF PLASTIC AND PLASTIC IS AN INSULATOR OR METAL IS A CONDUCTOR
ONE OF THE WIRES IS GETTING TO THE MOTOR BUT THE OTHER ONE THE MOTOR IT BUT THE OTHER ONE IS GOING TO THE SWITCH AND THE SWITCH IS OPEN BUT THE PAPERCLIP COMPLETES THE SWITCH IN A HAS THE WIRE GOING BACK TO THE MOTOR
GOOD
THE METAL
GOOD BYE
OKAY
I THINK IT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE CLOSED BECAUSE IT STILL GOT COMPLETING IT
THEY ARE MOSTLY MADE OF METAL I DON’T THINK THERE ARE ANY OTHERS THAT ARE NOT METAL BUT IF THEY ARE METAL THEN YOU KNOW THEY ARE CONDUCTORS
ONE IS A SCREW IT MUST BE SOMETHING TO REPLACE THE TO MAKE IT THE OPEN CIRCUIT
TRYING TO GET A
ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE INSULATORS BUT DOES NOT COME OUT THE OTHER END
THE CRAFT STICK ISN’T MAKING A DIFFERENCE SO IT’S STILL OPEN
IT TAKES THE ENERGY FROM THE WIRES AND IT DOESN’T LET IT GET TO THE TO THE MOTOR
THE CRAP STICK KEEPS IT FROM KEEPS THE ELECTRICITY FROM FLOWING BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ALL OF IT
THE CIRCUIT WITH THE INSULATOR WILL HAVE THE ELECTRICITY GO TO THE INSULATOR INSTEAD OF THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR SO IT CAN’T REACH THE MOTOR
THEY’RE METAL
INSULATORS DO NOT LET THE ELECTRICITY FLOW THROUGH THEM
THESE OBJECTS ARE ALL MADE OF METAL
ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE PAPERCLIP
IT THE WIRES HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THAT LITTLE KNOB AT THE END OF THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OR ELSE THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T GET BACK IN
IT MEANS THAT UM THAT'S WHAT CAN THAT'S THE PATHWAY THAT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH TO GET TO THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETISM
I THINK THE ELECTRICITY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FLOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE ON THE CASING AND ONE ON THE BASE OR ELSE IT DOESN'T MAKE IT OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB
THOUGHT IT WAS THE ELECTRICITY SO IT CAN REACH THE LIGHT BULB
THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE NO MATTER WHAT GETS THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND COMES BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE NO MATTER WHAT WHAT PLACE IT'S IN EXCEPT IF IT'S ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BULB
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FLOW OF THE THE ELECTRICITY IT STILL FLOWS THE SAME WAY BUT IT ACTUALLY IT STILL FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE BUT IT JUST TRAVELING IT'S TRAVELING THE OTHER WAY THROUGH THE OTHER WIRES
CARRY ELECTRICITY FROM THE THE BATTERY TO THE LIGHT BULB AND FROM THE LIGHTBULB TO THE BATTERY
IT MEANS THAT THE CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY NEVER REALLY STOPS IT JUST KEEPS MOVING
THE BATTERIES ARE THE STORED ELECTRICITY THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE TWO WIRES ON THE ENDS AND CONNECT THEM TO THE LIGHT BULB THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE LIGHT THAT'S THE THING THAT MAKES THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT UP
THE POSITIVE SIDE RECEIVES IT AND THE BATTERY JUST KEEPS SENDING IT OUT AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING UNTIL YOU ONE OF THE WIRES
(())
THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP NO MATTER WHICH SIDE YOU HAVE ON THE CASING YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE ONE ON THE CASING ONE ON THE BASE THAT'S IT
(()) IS THAT THE NEGATIVE WIRE THE NEGATIVE WIRE (()) LET ME TRY THAT AGAIN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING THAT THE THE UM THE BOTTOM OF IT WHEN YOU START IT OUT BUT YOU CAN FLIP IT AROUND IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
THE LIGHT BULBS ARE UM WHAT YOU NEED ELECTRICITY TO TURN ON AND OFF AND WHEN WERE AND (())
I'M FINE
THE LITTLE BLUE BALLS ARE TRAVELING THROUGH THE WIRE AND GETTING TO THE LIGHT BULB AND GOING BACK TO THE BATTERY I THINK THE BLUE BALLS OR BALLS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY
THE NEGATIVES WIRE FLOWS INTO THE LIGHT BULB THE LIGHT BULB FLIES INTO THE FLOWS INTO THE POSITIVE WIRE THE POSITIVE WIRE (()) TRAVEL INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE TOWARDS THE POSITIVE SIDE
THAT'S WHERE THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM TO HEAT UP THE LITTLE PART THAT LIGHTS THE LIGHT
BLUE DOTS REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING
WHEN IT'S HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE CASING OR THE BASE OF THE LIGHT BULB OR ELSE IT CAN'T FLOW BECAUSE THE OUTSIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB LIKE THE GLASS DOES NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
(()) THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP IS IF YOU HAVE BOTH ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY SIDES LIKE THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE CONNECTING TO IT
THE WIRES ARE THE THINGS THAT CONNECTS CONNECT THE ENERGY SOURCE TO THE WHATEVER YOU ARE POWERING LIKE FOR THIS EXAMPLE LIGHT BULBS
THAT IT HAS TO BE THAT UM FROM (()) THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT GOES INTO THE LIGHT BULB WITH THE WIRE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN WHEN IT GOES OUT THE UH THE POSITIVE SIDE WIRE GOES IN THE BOTTOM AND THEN THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS BACK INTO THE BATTERY
A BATTERY A LIGHT BULB TWO WIRES
(()) ELECTRICITY FLOWS FROM THE NEGATIVE END THROUGH THE WIRE THROUGH WHATEVER YOU'RE CONNECTING IT TO BACK TO THE POSITIVE END
WITHOUT THE WIRES UM THERE WOULD BE NO UH CONNECTION OF ELECTRICITY AND THEN IT WOULD UM NOT LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB
IT'S THE RECEIVER OF THE ELECTRICITY THAT MEANS IT GETS THE ELECTRICITY AND IT ALSO SENDS IT BACK WHERE IT'S MOSTLY JUST RECEIVING IT TO LIGHTEN IT UP
IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT EACH HAS IT’S OWN LITTLE PATHWAY SO IT’S BOTH GO COMING FROM IT FROM THE BATTERY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND IT’S FOR BOTH OF THEM BUT THEY’RE STILL CONNECTED ON THE BATTERY ON THE SAME ONE
FOR BOTH OF THE LIGHTBULBS THEY HAVE TO SHARE ONE D-CELL
OUT OF THE NEGATIVE BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING FROM BOTH ENDS FROM THE SAME- FROM THE SAME END- LET ME <INDISCERNIBLE> HERE THE BULBS ARE GETTING NEGATIVE ENERGY THAT'S COMING THROUGH BOTH OF THE WIRES GOING TO LIGHT BULB AND COMING BACK TO THE POSITIVE AND THEN THE POSITIVE AND THEN THE POSITIVE GETS BACK TO THE NEGATIVE THAT GOES INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE OTHER ONE AND THEN GOES INTO NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY THAT THEY GETTING THE NEGATIVE FROM
YES
THEY ARE MUCH BRIGHTER
COMES FROM THE- COME FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOES THROUGH GO GOES INTO THE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE SIDE WAIT NO POSITIVE SIDE
I THINK A PARALLEL VERY LONG PARALLEL WOULD HELP WITH THE BULBS IN LIGHTING THEM UP
IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BUT ITS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE THE BOTH OF THE WIRES ARE GOING THE SAME WAY WITH GOING TO THE DIFFERENT LIGHTBULBS
<NO_SIGNAL>
FLOW IS COMING FROM THE NEGATIVE GOING INTO THE BULB BUT ALSO THE OTHER WIRES GETTING SOME OF THE NEGATIVE TOO SO IT’S START FLOWING GOES TO THE LIGHTBULB COMES OUT OF THE LIGHTBULB GOES TO THE OTHER LIGHTBULB GOES UP AND THEN BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
ADDING A BETTER RIVET IT CAN SPLIT IT UP INTO TWO DIFFERENT CIRCUITS
A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
WE’VE BEEN WORKING WITH OPEN CIRCUITS CLOSED CIRCUITS AND PARALLELS CIRCUIT
THEY ARE A LOT BRIGHTER
<SIDE_SPEECH>
<SIDE_SPEECH>
IT IS A- IT’S A COMPLETE CIRCUIT FOR BOTH OF THEM
THEY HAVE TO SHARE A PATHWAY AND IT’S LIGHT WEAKER BECAUSE THE LIGHTBULB’S HAD ALREADY HAD USED SOME OF THAT FOR THEIR OWN ENERGY
BOTH OF THE LIGHTBULBS GET THEIR OWN LITTLE CIRCUIT INSTEAD OF SHARING ONE BIG ONE
THERE IS ONLY ONE BULB OUT OF ONE OF THEM BUT IT’S SECOND BULB ON THE OTHER
THE ENERGY IS COMING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IT SPLITS INTO THE TWO WIRES GOES TO THE LIGHTBULB AND GOES AROUND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE TWICE ABOUT THE
THEY GET EVEN BRIGHTER
BOTH OF THE LIGHTBULBS GET THEIR OWN PATHWAY
ONE IS JUST GETTING IT’S ELECTRICITY FROM THE OTHER ONE
SO THERE'S ONE WIRE COMING FROM THE NEGATIVE GOES TO ONE OF THE LIGHTBULBS IT COMES ALSO OUT OF THE LIGHTBULB WHATEVER <SIDE_SPEECH> NO I’M THINKING OF RIGHT THERE <NOISE> OKAY YOU’RE NOT PUTTING IT ALL TOUGH OKAY AND DON’T USE MY STUFF SORRY ABOUT THAT THERE’S A WIRE FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IT GOES TO THE LIGHTBULB AND COMES OUT OF THE LITTLE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHTBULB GOES TO THE OTHER LIGHTBULB AND IT GOES ALL THE WAY AROUND THE LITTLE PART COMES OUT AND THEN THE WIRE CONNECTS THE TWO LIGHTBULBS RIGHT THERE AND THEN IT’S SHARING ELECTRICITY SO IT GOES BACK TO THE OTHER LIGHTBULB TO THE D-CELL
THERE IS TWO PATHWAYS ONE IS JUST COMING FROM A LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER ONE IS ACTUALLY COMING FROM THE D-CELL
THE LIGHTBULBS ARE JUST GETTING SOME ENERGY FROM THEMSELVES THAT’S ALREADY BEEN USED
WE ESTIMATED WELL IT'S MAKING A GOOD GUESS AND LIKE IF YOU'RE MEASURING I MEAN IF YOU'RE ESTIMATING LIKE A BOX FULL OF SOMETHING AND IT'S CLEAR <BREATH> I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD LIKE FIRST COUNT THE ONES ON THE EDGES JUST TO AND THEN MAKE IT MORE
WELL IT'S LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEVER CHANGES
BECAUSE THEN IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME LIKE IF YOU JUST USED BODY PARTS <BREATH> USUALLY YOUR HANDS ARE IF YOU'VE USED YOUR HANDS THEN USUALLY THEY'RE DIFFERENT A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIZES SO IT'D BE VERY WEIRD LOTS OF THEM GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS
WERE THEY <BREATH> SOME OF THEM WERE SIMILAR BUT SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY DIFFERENT
UM I THINK THAT ONE OF THEM WAS
THAT AMERICA'S THE ONLY PLACE THAT DOESN'T USE THE METRIC SYSTEM
MMM HMM MMM YEAH
MMM NO
<BREATH> UM WE DID SOMETHING WITH ROBOTS WE <BREATH> WE HAD TO PUT OUR ROBOT <BREATH> WE HAD TO GET OUR ROBOT OUT OF THE CLASSROOM INTO THE OFFICE
UM WE'VE BEEN MA WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MASS ABOUT MASS MMM HMM
YES <BREATH> WELL WE'VE BEEN MEASURING OUR DESK WITH STRAWS <BREATH> AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT NOT WHEN WE MEASURE WITH STRAWS THAT IT ISN'T A STANDARD UNIT OF MEASUREMENT BECAUSE NOT EVERY STRAW IS THE SAME
UM I LEARNED THAT
BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE WOULDN'T REALLY HAVE THE SAME THINGS LIKE IF YOU WANTED A HOUSE TO BE AS BIG LIKE A MANSION OR SOMETHING AND THEN IT WAS REALLY SMALL THEN IT'D BE KIND OF DISAPPOINTING
MMM THAT MEASURING A PERSON IS I MEAN ESTIMATING HOW A PERSON IS BIG IT'S PRETTY HARD BECAUSE WHEN YOU <BREATH> YOU'RE LIKE SOMETIMES YOU THINK THAT IT'S JUST NINETY SIX AND IT'S REALLY LIKE A METER AND TWENTY FIVE YEAH
WE'VE BEEN TODAY WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MASS AND WE WERE DOING THE WE WERE USING PAPER CLIPS A AND A PLASTIC COIN AND WE WERE WE WANTED TO SEE <BREATH> HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS IT WOULD TAKE TO USE THE COIN AND ONE TABLE THEY SAID NONE <BREATH> AND OUR TABLE THEY SAID TWO AND THEN ANOTHER TABLE SAID THREE AND IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZES
MMM NO
WELL UM LIKE I SAID WE TRIED TO FIND SOMETHING ON OUR BODY THAT WAS ONE INCH SIX INCHES AND
WELL BECAUSE THE KING MADE A COPY OF HIS FOOT THE SAME BIG AND AND THEN HE GAVE IT TO THE *APPRENTICE* AND THEN HE MADE THE BED
IT NEVER CHANGES
MMM NO
BECAUSE IT'S NOT A <BREATH> NOT ALL STRAWS ARE THE SAME HEIGHT
BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE SOMETIMES WHEN THEY WHEN THEY USUALLY GET THEIR ESTIMATE BY THEN THEY WON'T HAVE TO ER
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME <BREATH> IT NEVER CHANGES
YES WE WE CUT IT OUT THEM WE COULD <BREATH> WELL UM ONCE WE CUT IT OUT THE METER TAPES WE
NO
IT'S IT'S
IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T CAUSE IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO MEASURE SOMETHING THEN THEY IT WOULDN'T BE REALLY THE SAME
WE WE GOT A PA WE GOT A PIECE OF PAPER AND WE HAD TO FIND WE WE HAD TO S FIND SOMETHING UM WE WE HAD TO MEASURE A THING AND THEN WRITE OUR ESTIMATE AND THEN WRITE WHAT IT REALLY WAS AND THEN WRITE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
YEAH WE UM WE
UM THAT IT HAS A HUNDRED CENTIMETERS
YES WE'VE BEEN <BREATH> WELL ONE DAY IN MATH WE HAD THESE STATIONS AND ONE STATION <BREATH> WAS WE WE BLUE PATTERN BLOCKS AND THEN MEASURED IN CENTIMETERS HOW LONG THEY WENT AND THEN ANOTHER ONE WAS <BREATH> WHERE WE TRIED TO JUMP AS FAR AS WE COULD AND THEN WE GOT METER STICKS AND MEASURED HOW LONG AND THEN WE HAD TO FIND UM ON OUR BODY PARTS WHICH ONE LIKE SOMETHING THAT WAS ONE INCH SOMETHING THAT WAS SIX INCHES SOMETHING THAT WAS ONE FOOT AND SOMETHING THAT WAS THREE FEET AND THEN WE HAD TO DO A PACKET
WE *TRIED* TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WAS A METER IN THE ROOM AND ALMOST ALL OF US SAID THE METER STICK
MEASURED UM THE BOOKSHELF
OKAY
UM BECAUSE THEN IF YOU WANTED TO MEASURE SOMETHING LIKE WE READ THE BOOK HOW BIG IS A FOOT AND IT'S ABOUT A KING AND HE WANTS TO MAKE A BED FOR THE QUEEN AND HE CALLS THE APPRENTICE AND HE THE APPRENTICE IS REALLY SMALL AND HAS REALLY SMALL FEET AND HE SAYS THAT THE BED <BREATH> SHOULD BE SIX FEET TALL AND THREE FEET WIDE AND SO THE BED WAS REALLY TINY AND THEN IT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FIT THE QUEEN
MMM NO
WELL THEY HAD LIKE THIS TIP AT THE ONE END AND THEN IT WAS LIKE A TUBE WITH THIS PUSHY THING AT THE END AND YOU P YEAH YEAH YEAH SYRINGE AND WE WE PUT THE SYRINGES AND MISS GATES TOLD US TO PUT PUT IT TO TWENTY FIVE FIFTY AND THIRTY SEVEN AND THEN ANOTHER DAY WE TOOK THE SYRINGES AND THEN WE WELL MY TABLE WE GOT THIS HUGE BOTTLE AND WE HAD TO FILL IT UP AND THEN WE'D HAD TO REMEMBER HOW MANY SYRINGES IT'D GET INSIDE OR HOW MANY IT WOULD TA HOLD AND SO OURS WAS LIKE A BIG SODA BOTTLE AND THE GROUP THAT WAS NEXT TO US THEY GOT LIKE A LITTLE TEENY TINY <BREATH> BOTTLE SO WHEN THEY FINISHED OURS THEY POURED IT INTO OURS CAUSE OURS IT NEVER WANTED TO GO GROW BIG BUT ONCE THEY PUT THEIRS INSIDE IT WAS <BREATH> ALMOST TO THE TOP
YEAH YEAH BUT WE TOOK TURNS DOING IT SO IT TOOK LONGER INSTEAD OF JUST ONE PERSON
YEAH WE WERE THE LAST ONES TO FINISH MMM YEAH YEAH AND THEN AND THEN WE USED THIS ONE HUNDRED CUP THAT HAD ONE HUNDRED AND THEN WE PUT IT INSIDE BUT THAT WASN'T SO GOOD EITHER <LAUGH> UM IT DIDN'T FILL UP SO MUCH EITHER BECAUSE THE SYRINGE WAS JUST FIFTY <FP> IT DID IT A LITTLE FASTER BUT NOT SO FAST SO
MMM YES <BREATH> WELL WE WERE WE GOT UM <BREATH> OH THESE <BREATH> <FP> I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY'RE CALLED
YEAH MAYBE
YES IT'S IT'S THE ONLY IT'S THE ONLY MEASUREMENT THAT IT'S IT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT WE DON'T USE EVERY OTHER COUNTRY USES IT
UM THAT WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE UM <BREATH> THE TEMPERATURE THE THERMOMETER UM
IT MIGHT BE CAUSE I WAS MOVING IT WELL WELL I WAS I WAS PUTTING THE THERMOMETER LIKE ON ONE SIDE SO WE COULD SEE IT BETTER
YEAH AND AND WE ALSO YEAH AND WE ALSO MESSED UP WELL WELL I DIDN'T I I MESSED UP ON ONE OTHER THING I MESSED UP ON WELL UM I THOUGHT THAT THE F AND THE A WAS TURNED AROUND BUT IT WASN'T
OKAY
<LAUGH> YEAH
UM UM UM I DON'T KNOW
NO
MMM BECAUSE THEY'RE REALD- REALLY LITTLE TEENY TINY LINES AND YOU CAN SCARCELY SEE WHERE IT IS AND IT WAS LIKE <BREATH> SOMETIMES IN BETWEEN
YES BECAUSE OUR FINGERS THEY HAVE DIFFERENT FEELINGS AND THAT'S WHY A FINGER ISN'T A STANDARD UNIT OF MEASUREMENT YEAH
UM IT'S <BREATH> YEAH EXCEPT IT WAS JUST A SMALLER PIECE OF PAPER UH IT WAS A SMALLER IT DIDN'T HAVE ALL OF THE LINES AND IT DIDN'T HAVE THE NUMBERS EITHER SO IT SAYS THAT IT STARTED AT TEN AND THEN AT S EIGHTEEN MINUTES YEAH YEAH
MMM NO
MMM <FP> IN THE BEGINNING NO BUT IN THE END SORT OF YEAH UM <BREATH>
YEAH YEAH <BREATH> UM MAYBE BECAUSE
WELL WE WERE JUST STARING AT THE CLOCK AND WE WE NOT NOT EVERY TIME WE STARTED AT THE TWELVE <BREATH> BECAUSE THEN IT'D TAKE EVEN MORE TIME CAUSE WE JUST WAITED TIL IT GOT TO ONE CERTAIN NUMBER LIKE NOT IN BETWEEN
YEAH COLDER
BECAUSE <BREATH> MAYBE BECAUSE UM
YEAH AND THEN BECAUSE THE THERMOMETER IT WASN'T USED TO THAT TEMPERATURE BECAUSE IT WAS JUST AN ERROR AND THEN UM THE THERMOMETER GOT USED TO IT SO IT SO IT SORT OF STAYED THE SAME
UM <FP> I NOTICED THAT THE WATER WHEN THE ICE CUBE MELTED IT WAS COLDER THAN IF THE ICE CUBE WAS STILL IN THERE
YEAH WELL WE HAD THIS PIECE OF PAPER AND ON ONE SIDE IT SAID MINUTES AND THEN ZERO ONE AND ALL THE WAY UP TO TEN AND THEN IT SAID TEMPERATURE ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THERE WERE LOTS OF BOXES LIKE TEN BOXES AND WE HAD TO WRITE THE TEMPERATURE FOR EVERY MINUTE INSIDE
MMM YES EXCEPT WE DIDN'T LIKE DO COLD MEDIUM WE JUST SAID IT IN THE ORDER
<BREATH> OH OH I SAW A COUPLE OF EM WE WELL UM WE DID THIS ALSO AND WE EVERY TABLE HAD A NAME AND IT WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO E AND THEN WE PUT OUR FINGER IN EVERY SINGLE ONE AND TRIED TO PUT THEM IN ORDER FROM THE COLDEST TO WARMEST AND OUR TABLE WAS THE COLDEST
SHOULD I
<BREATH> UM IT ALWAYS HAS TO BE NO AIR INSIDE IT SO SO YOU CAN GET THE WATER INSIDE <BREATH> UM
YEAH YEAH AND THEN OUR TEACHER SHE ONLY <FP> MESSED UP ON THE LAST TWO
YEAH AND ONE TIME IT WAS AT LIKE AT SEVEN THEN IT WAS AT SIX <BREATH> THEN IT WAS AT SEVEN THEN IT WAS AT EIGHT THEN IT WAS AT SIX YEAH IT WAS WEIRD
YEAH YEAH
YEAH SHE SHE SHE DID BUT THEN CAUSE SHE THOUGHT THAT UM E WENT BEFORE B I MEAN E WENT AFTER B AND BUT IT DIDN'T OURS WAS COLDER
IT MAKES IT COLDER YEAH YEAH NO IT HAS TO Y IT HAS TO STAY THERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE SO THAT IT COULD SO THAT IT COULD KIND OF MELT A LITTLE MMM HMM
UM <BREATH> THE TEMPERATURE WAS USUALLY IT STARTED AT TWELVE AND THEN ENDED AT SIX SO IT WAS IN BETWEEN THOSE
WELL WE GOT THESE TUBES SORT OF LIKE AND THEN WE FILLED THEM UP WITH WATER LIKE WE PULLED THIS BUTTON AND
Y UM
<BREATH> YEAH
MMM <BREATH> YEAH YEAH YEAH WE WE PUT ICE CUBES INSIDE UH WATER AND THEN WE GOT THIS PIECE OF PAPER AND WE PUT A THERMOMETER INSIDE AND EVERY TIME THE HAND THE MINUTE HAND WENT AROUND WE WOULD WE WOULD CHECK THE TEMPERATURE AND WRITE IT DOWN ON THE PIECE OF PAPER AND THEN THE SECOND MINUTE AND THEN THE THIRD MINUTE ALL THE WAY UP TO TEN YEAH UH PROBABLY IF IT IF IT EVER CHANGED THAT THE THERMOMETER WASN'T INSIDE THERE SO LONG
YEAH
MMM HMM UH I'VE I'VE ONE TIME WHEN I WAS SWIMMING AT A BEACH THAT HAPPENED TO ME LIKE THE WATER WAS REAL COLD AND THEN WHEN ONE SPOT IT WAS REALLY WARM
UM MAYBE BECAUSE WE COULDN'T TELL IT SO WELL THAT
AND UM <BREATH> THE TEMPERATURE PROBABLY CHANGED BECAUSE BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE PROBABLY TOOK A LITTLE THERMOMETER BECAUSE THEMO- THERMOMETER CAUSE OF THE ICE CUBE THAT IT WAS CHANGING
UM JUST KEEP IT IN ONE SPOT
YEAH
THAT <BREATH> THAT TEN THAT
<FP> UM WE DIDN'T USE THE LITTLE CUBES WE JUST USED PAPER CLIPS INSTEAD
IT'S NO
GRAMS GRAMS AND WE USED THE THE BLOCKS TO UM MAKE IT WE PUT A HUNDRED OF THE BLOCKS INSIDE AND THEN WE TRIED TO MAKE IT EQUAL
YES MMM NO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THAT TEN ONE HUNDRED BAGS OF GRAMS WOULD EQUAL ONE KILOGRAM
WELL WE PUT THE BALANCE BOARD ON ONTO THE BEAM <BREATH> AND THEN WE PUT THE CUPS INSIDE AND WE GOT A CHIP AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS THE PAPER CLIPS WERE ONE AND <BREATH> THERE WERE THESE CUBES AND ONE WAS TEN AND ONE WAS FIFTEEN AND ONE WAS TWENTY AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY IT WOULD TAKE TO EQUAL ONE CHIP
MMM NOT YET
YES
YEAH
UH WELL USUALLY LIKE MINE WERE FIVE AWAY SOMETIMES
OH OH YEAH WE HAD THIS <BREATH> AND EACH PERSON WE WENT AROUND THE TABLE AND EACH PERSON TOOK A THING AND THEY PUT IT INSIDE THE CUP AND THEN EACH PERSON AT THE TABLE MET ESTIMATED AND THEN WE ACTUALLY MEASURED
YEAH IT WAS JUST THOSE THINGS
HELLO
WE WE TRIED TO GET WITH OUR WITH OUR GRAMS WE TRIED TO GET
MMM KIND OF
IT'S NOT A STANDARD UNIT OF MEASUREMENT
YES <BREATH> THE THE CHIP
YEAH MMM HMM BECAUSE THESE THINGS WEIGH ALL THE SAME AMOUNT
NO
YEAH
THAT <FP> EVERYBODY USES THE SAME THING
BECAUSE WHEN WE PUT IN THE PAPER CLIP IT WOULD MOVE A LITTLE AND THEN WHEN WE PUT A LOT IN THEN IT WOULD BE EQUAL
UM IT'S DIVIDED BY IT'S DIVISION
IT WAS NONE I MEAN THREE MMM HMM MMM HMM BECAUSE THEY WERE TINY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
LIKE I SAID THESE WERE LIKE THE CUBES THE ONE AND THE FIVE
YEAH
BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE GOT TINY PAPER CLIPS AND SOME BIG PAPER CLIPS AND WE GOT HUGE PAPER CLIPS MMM HMM
NO
YEAH
UM <BREATH> WE TRIED TO GET UM A HUNDRED AND WE USED THE
YES
YEAH OR OR USING THE THE BOX THAT WOULD TAKE FOREVER
UM THE GRAMS
WE TRIED WE PUT LIKE I SAID THE CUBES <BREATH> AND IF IT WAS TOO MUCH WE'D PUT SOMETHING LESS AND WE WE WOULD ALSO USE THE PAPER CLIPS AND <BREATH> WE WERE ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME WE TOOK THE PAPER CLIPS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WOULD EQUAL A WOODEN BLOCK AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT ONE TABLE WAS LIKE NINE AND AND ONE ONE TABLE WAS THREE AND IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL DIFFERENT SIZES
INSTEAD CAUSE INSTEAD OF USING ALL OF THOSE BLOCKS WE COULD JUST USE
YES
YEAH
WELL WE PUT GRAVEL INTO A BAG AND THEN
WHEN THE POWDERS MIXED WITH THE WATER GRAPE BEING MADE AND THE POWDERS DISSOLVING
IT IS CALLED A SOLVENT
CALLED THE OTHER COMPONENT A SOLUTE
THAT IN THE FIRST CUP THERE IS MORE POWDER SO IT'S MORE CONCENTRATED AND A DARKER COLOR IN THE SECOND CUP IT'S LESS CONCENTRATED AND A LIGHTER COLOR
IT WOULD TASTE SUGAR AND THICKER IF IT HAD A HIGHER CONCENTRATION
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU JUST SAID SO
TO MAKE A SOLUTION YOU ADD THE GRAPE FANTASTIC TO THE WATER OR THE SOLUTE AND MIX EM SOLID SOLUTE
WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING CONCENTRATION
THE DARKER SOLUTIONS ARE MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE LIGHTER SOLUTIONS HAVE A DARKER COLOR AND PROBABLY TASTE DIFFERENT
YOU CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE DRINK BY
TO DETERMINE CONCENTRATION YOU CAN USE WEIGHT TO TELL WHICH IS MORE CONCENTRATED
BECAUSE THEY ARE DILUTED AND THERE IS LESS POWDER IN THEM
THE WATER IN A SOLUTION IS A SOLVENT
WE CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE COOL AID BY HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE COOL AID
THE CONCENTRATION WOULD BE MORE IF THERE WAS LESS WATER AND MORE POWDER
YOU CAN CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION BY HOW MUCH WATER'S IN THE CUP
I CAN TELL IT'S MORE OR LESS CONCENTRATED BY HOW MUCH THE COLOR IS THE DARKER COLOR IS MORE CONCENTRATED IS THE LIGHTER COLOR IS LESS CONCENTRATED
IN THIS ANIMATION ONE CUP OF WATER THERE ARE TWO CUPS OF WATER ONE GETS MORE CONCENTRATED CAUSE IT HAS TWO SPOONS OF GRAPE FANTASTIC THE SECOND ONE IS LESS CONCENTRATED BECAUSE IT ONLY HAS ONE SPOON OF GRAPE FANTASTIC
WE CAN TELL A SOLUTION HAS MORE OR LESS SOLVENT UM BY WHAT COLOR IT IS OR HOW CONCENTRATED IT IS
THE TASTE WOULD BE DIFFERENT IN THAT THE ONE WITH FIVE SPOONFULS AND FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER WOULD HAVE MORE TASTE AND TASTE THICKER THAN THE ONE WITH ONLY ONE SPOONFUL
THE TASTE IS THICKER AND MORE STRONG I GUESS OH
YOU
IN CLASS WE USED A SCALE TO TELL WHICH WAS MORE CONCENTRATED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO
<NO_SIGNAL>
THEY ARE DILUTED AND HAVE LESS COLOR
(()) A SOLUTION
THAT IT IS A MIXTURE NOT WAIT NO IT'S A SOLUTION SORRY IT IS NOT A MIXTURE IT IS A SOLUTION
THE ANIMATION SHOWED THAT WHEN YOU ADD MORE GRAMS THAT IT BECOMES HEAVIER
GOOD
THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER
I THINK IT'S A PROPERTY OF A SOLUTION
THE FLOUR FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WATER THEN IT GETS POURED INTO THE FILTER AND ONLY THE WATER COMES THROUGH THE FILTER BECAUSE THE FLOUR HAS BIGGER PARTICLES THAN THE FILTER
ANIMATIONS MARNEY
I NOTICED THAT FIFTY GRAMS THE WATER PLUS FIFTEEN GRAMS THE SALT EQUALS SIXTY FIVE GRAMS THE SALT AND THE WATER
THEY BECOME HEAVIER AND THE SALT DISSOLVES
IT IS BEING ADDED
THAT IT IS A MIXTURE
THE SALT DOES THE DISSOLVING
IT IS A MIXTURE
<SILENCE>
YOU CAN FILTER OUT A SOLUTE IN A SOLUTION
THE WATER IS PLAYING THE SOLUTION
THE SALT DISSOLVED INTO THE WATER
THE SOLID IN THIS PICTURE IS THE WATER
CONSIDERED A SOLUTION MARNEY I HAVE TO GO NOW
THE SALT DISSOLVES INTO THE WATER SO ALL OF IT CAN GO THROUGH THE FILTER
IT SHOWS THAT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS ARE MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
WE LEARNED HOW TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT MATERIAL
THAT WHEN YOU MIX THINGS THEY HAVE BOTH THE WEIGHTS COMBINED
SOMETHING LIKE SALT
THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE EQUALS NO A DISSOLVED SALT MIXTURE THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE EQUALS A MIXTURE THAT IS BROWN WHERE THE SAND HAS NOT DISSOLVED
THE MIXED END RESULT HAS ALL OF THE PEANUTS RAISINS AND M AND MS
GOOD BYE MARNEY
THE NUMBER UNDERNEATH THE FINAL CUP IS BOTH THE FIFTY GRAMS AND THE FIFTEEN GRAMS COMBINED EQUALING SIXTY FIVE GRAMS
GOOD BYE MARNEY
IT IS A MIXTURE
BY LETTING THE SOLUTE EVAPORATE
THE SALT AND WATER MIXTURE DISSOLVES THE SAND AND WATER MIXTURE DOES NOT DISSOLVE
REPEAT THAT PLEASE
A MIXTURE
IN THIS ANIMATION AS THE MONTHS PASSED FIRST RAIN GETS POURED ON THE BIKE THEN SNOW GETS LEFT ON THE BIKE AND WHEN THE SNOW FINALLY MELTS THERE IS RUST LEFT BECAUSE IT HAS
WHEN THE SOLUTIONS WERE ADDED TOGETHER THE TWO PRODUCTS WERE ADDED TOGETHER THE SOLUTION BUBBLED AND FIZZED UP TO THE TOP BUT THEN IT CALMED DOWN INTO CLEAR BLUE WATER
SOME ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE APART
A REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE THE WATER FIZZED UP AND THEN CALMED DOWN
WELL AT FIRST THE PRODUCTS WERE BLUE WHEN ADDED TOGETHER THEY BECAME PURPLE SO THEREFORE I THINK IT IS A CHEMICAL REACTION
IN THIS ANIMATION BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE ARE ADDED TO AN EMPTY CUP THEN WHEN WATER IS ADDED THE SOLUTION FIZZES UP AND THE BAKING SODA AND THE CALCIUM CHLORIDE DISSOLVE INTO THE WATER AND WHEN IT FIZZES UP IT CREATES BUBBLES THAT RELEASED MAKING C O TWO THEN WHEN IT CALMS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM THERE IS SOME PRECIPITATE
THE SCIENTIFIC TERM IS PRODUCT
WE CALLED THEM REACTANTS
NO THERE IS NOT
THE CHEMICAL REACTION IS HERE BECAUSE WHEN THE CARBONATED WATER IS BEING POURED INTO THE EMPTY GLASS IT FIZZES
THE REACTANT MOLECULES LOOK LIKE THE PRODUCT MOLECULE
THERE IS NOT A REACTION BECAUSE BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A SECOND PRODUCT
BYE MARNI I HAD A LOT OF FUN MAKING SANDWICHES RIDING ON UNICORNS AND PLAYING MARIO
I THINK C O TWO WAS CREATED
I THINK THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION CAUSE WHEN THE ICE CUBES ARE ADDED THEY FLOAT TO THE BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME THE GLASS GETS FOGGY AND WET
I DO THINK THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE THERE IS A BUBBLY
TWO PRODUCTS ARE BEING ADDED TOGETHER AT FIRST THEY ARE CLEAR AND BLUE BUT WHEN ADDED TURN
THE WATER GLASS GOT FOGGY
WELL FIRST I LEARNED HOW TO MAKE A SANDWICH THEN I RODE ON A RAINBOW UNICORN LAST BUT NOT LEAST I PLAYED IN THE SNOW
WHEN YOU MOUSE OVER THE THINGS MOLECULES
THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE WHEN THE GLOW STICK IS BENT IT LIGHTS UP AND GLOWS SO THE INGREDIENTS INSIDE GET MIXED TOGETHER TO MAKE A GLOWING SUBSTANCE
CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND BAKING SODA WERE MIXED CALCIUM CHLORIDE AND CITRIC ACID WERE MIXED AND BAKING SODA AND CITRIC ACID WERE MIXED IN CUP ONE TWO AND
IT CAN BE SEPARATED
BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
IN THIS ANIMATION BAKING SODA IS ADDED TO VINEGAR AND THE VINEGAR AND BAKING THE VINEGAR IS A SOLVENT THAT THE BAKING SODA DISSOLVES INTO CREATED A CHEMICAL REACTION WHERE THE SOLUTION FIZZED UP TO THE TOP CREATING C O TWO
WATER BAKING SODA AND CALCIUM CHLORIDE
I THINK A TYPE OF GAS WAS CREATED
IN THIS ANIMATION UH SODIUM HYDROXIDE IS ADDED TO WATER AS ADDED TO FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER SO IT HYDRAULIC ACID THE WATER BECOMES A LITTLE MORE FOGGY AND IT BECOMES A SOLUTION
THERE ARE TWO CUPS ONE HAS WATER IN IT AND THERE'S TWO SPOONS ONE HAS BAKING SODA IN IT AND ONE HAS CALCIUM CHLORIDE
THE WATER IS GAINING MOLECULES FROM THE HYDRAULIC ACID
WE CALLED THESE REACTANT
REACTANT
THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION WHEN ADDED TOGETHER THEY BECOME FIZZY AND FILL UP TO THE TOP BUT AFTER A COUPLE OF SECONDS IT CALMS DOWN INTO CLEAR BLUE
UM REPEAT PLEASE
THE ONE TO THE LEFT IS CITRIC ACID THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS BAKING SODA AND THE ONE TO THE RIGHT IS CALCIUM CHLORIDE
SOME OF THE MOLECULES ARE TOGETHER AND SOME ARE
AT THE END THE PRECIPITATE IS AT THE BOTTOM SITTING AND IT'S WHITE AND THE WATER IS AT THE TOP
NO THERE IS NOT BECAUSE NOTHING DISSOLVED INTO EACH OTHER
THE VINEGAR HAS SMALL YELLOW AND BLUE BALLS THE BAKING SODA HAS WHITE COMBINED BALLS AND WHEN THEY'RE ADDED TOGETHER THEY GET THESE BLUE AND WHITE BALLS A LITTLE BIT OF EACH
THERE IS SOME OF EACH TYPE OF MOLECULE IN THE SOLUTION
NO THERE IS NOT A CHEMICAL REACTION HERE I KNOW THIS BECAUSE THIS DID NOT FIZZ
THE WATER AT FIRST JUST HAS BLUE MOLECULES THEN WHEN THE HYDRAULIC ACID IS ADDED THERE IS PURPLE ODD LOOKING MOLECULES
CHEMICAL REACTION
THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION BECAUSE WHEN THE WATER IS ADDED ONTO THE PAN RUST IS FORMED
THERE IS A SOLUTION WHEN THE MIX THE INGREDIENTS INSIDE THE GLOW STICK ARE SHIFTED AND CRACK
A SOLVENT
VINEGAR AND BAKING SODA WAS ADDED TOGETHER AND IT IT IT CREATED C O TWO OR SOME TYPE OF GAS AND BUBBLED UP TO THE TOP
THEY ALWAYS CAN GO BACK TO THE REACTANTS BECAUSE EVERYTHING FROM EARTH CAN START OVER HOW IT WAS FIRST FORMED
I THINK THE BUBBLING IN WATER IS MISSING
I FORGET WHAT WE WERE DOING IN SCIENCE
I'M HAVING A BAD DAY MARNI
UM YEAH A CIRCUIT IS A FORM ELEC- OF ELECTRICITY
WE'VE BEEN MAKING CIRCUITS AND THE CIRCUITS MAKE THE L MAKE THE LIGHTS TURN ON
GOING THE GOOD WAY BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS STILL GOING OUT OF THE MMM NEGATIVE END
YES YOU CAN
ELL YOU JUST HAVE TO GET MORE WIRES AND ATTACH THE WIRES TO THE BATTERIES AND THEN YOU CAN STILL MAKE A CIRCUIT BUT IF YOU DO IT LIKE THIS THEN THE LIGHT BULB WILL PROBABLY BE WILL BE PROBABLY HAVE WILL BE PROBABLY BE EVEN MORE BRIGHT
IN THE WRONG <BREATH> IN THE WRONG PLACE BECAUSE ONE SIDE SHOULD BE NE
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UM ON ELECTRICITY
AND RECEIVES ELECTRICITY
WELL YOU JUST PUT A WIRE AND WELL FIRST YOU NEED YOU NEED A PLACE TO WELL FIRST YOU NEED TO HAVE A PLACE TO PUT THE YOU NEED TO HAVE A BATTERY HOLDER AND THEN YOU PUT THE BATTERY IN THERE AND THEN YOU GET THE OTHER WIRES AND THEN YOU ATTACH THE WIRES TO TO THE BATTERY
WELL IF YOU WANNA LIGHT SOMETHING THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE WIRES THAT ARE CONNECTED TO A BATTERY AND THE WIRES ALSO HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULB IN ORDER FOR IT TO LIGHT
THEY HAVE TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOR IT TO
UM WELL E THE IT'S THE WAY THAT THE IT'S THE WAY THAT THE THAT THE
YES IT IS
CAUSE IT BECAUSE THE NE CAUSE THE POSITIVE SIDE ALWAYS HAS TO BE ALWAYS HAS TO BE RECEIVING ENERGY
YES THIS PROBABLY WOULD WORK
ES THAT'S RIGHT
WELL THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A CIRCUIT AND SO THE ENERGY IS RU IS RUNNING FROM THE FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE LIGHT BULBS AND THEN AND THEN IT AND THEN IT MAKES UM THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT AND THEN IT COMES BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND GOES BACK TO THE NEGATIVE *SIDES* AND SIDE AND STARTS OVER ALL AND STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN
UM NO IT DOESN'T SHOW THE ENERGY ENERGY GOING TO THE LIGHT BUT UM I MEANT TO SAY THAT THE
WELL YOU CAN LIGHT A LIGHT BULB YOU CAN LIGHT MORE LIGHT BULBS IF YOU MAKE THE CIRCUIT LARGER
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
-EY UM IF THE PLUS SIDE I I MEAN THE NEGATIVE SIDE IS TOUCHING THE OTHER NEGATIVE SIDE THEN UM THEN IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE
SOME MORE YOU NEED MORE WIRES AND POSSIBLY MORE LIGHT BULBS BATTERIES AND THAT'S ALL
WE DID WORK WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS
WELL THE BATTERIES WILL PROBABLY BE IN
IT PROBABLY WILL WORK
YES
SO ONCE YOU HAVE A CIRCUIT AND THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULB THEN THE LIGHT BULB WILL LIGHT
YES THAT'S RIGHT
UM YES WE HAVE
UM THEN THE THEN THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS
THANK YOU
GOOD
WELL THE WELL THE TWO LINES ARE THE BATTERIES THE SHORT LINE AND THE LONG LINE AND THE S AND THE ODD SHAPE IN THE CIRCLE IS A LIGHT BULB AND THE LONG LINES THAT ALSO CURVE AROUND ARE WIRES TO MAKE THE LIGHT <BREATH> TO MAKE THE LIGHT GO TO TO MAKE THE ENERGY GO TO THE LIGHT
YES I TH I YES I HAVE
YOU'RE WELCOME
UM IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE NO DIFFERENCE
S
TO HAVE A CIRCUIT YOU HAVE TO GET YOU HAVE TO HAVE WIRES AND THEY HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO A BATTERY AND AN ELECTRICITY RECEIVER WHICH COULD BE A LIGHT BULB
THE BATTERY IS BEING USED TO LIGHT TWO LIGHT
NO BUT I THINK THAT IT WILL WORK LIKE THAT
THAT THE ELECTRICITY WORKS
ELECTRICITY IS WHAT WE USE TO HAVE TO HAVE LIGHT WITH AND HEATING AND WE USE A LOT OF ELECTRICITY
UM IN THIS PICTURE THERE'S ANOTHER CIRCUIT AND ALL THE ENERGY IS STILL RUNNING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHTER BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES
NOW IN THIS PICTURE THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES THAT ARE BEING USED TO UM LIGHT TWO LIGHT BULBS
TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT LARGER THEN YOU WILL NEED MORE YOUR
AND THE OTHER SIDE SHOULD PROBABLY BE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE
ES THAT'S RIGHT
ES YOU CAN STILL MAKE UM A CIRCUIT WITH TWO BATTERIES
YOU CLICK ON THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS DON'T LIGHT THAT'S BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS PROBABLY IN IN THE WRONG PLACE
THIS WOULD WORK TOO PROBABLY
YES IT WILL BE EVEN BRIGHTER THAN WITH ONE BATTERY
ELL UM A CIRCUIT IS SOME IS UM WELL IF YOU WANT TO LIGHT SOMETHING OR MAKE SOMETHING WORK THEN A CIRCUIT IS THE SHAPE THAT THE ELECTRICITY TRAVELS IN AND IT'S LIKE A CIRCLE SHAPE
YES SCIENCE IS VERY COOL
SO TODAY IN SCIENCE WE HAD TO MAKE WE HAD TO TRY TO USE A RIVET TO PICK UP TO PICK UP SOME TO PICK UP SOME LITTLE MET
BECAUSE IT USES ELECTRICITY TO TO BE A MAGNET AND PICK UP THINGS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY YOU CALL IT AN ELECTROMAGNET
WELL WE HAD TO ATTACH THE SWITCH OR WE HAD TO PUT THE SWITCH IN PLACE AND SO WE PUT THE BATTERY IN THE BATTERY HOLDER AND THEN WE ATTACHED THE WE HAD A FEW CORDS AND WE ATTACHED THE CORDS OR WE OR WE HAD A FEW WIRES AND WE <BREATH> ATTACHED A FEW WIRES TO THE TO THE SWITCH AND TO THE BATTERIES AND THEN WE WRAPPED THE WIRES AROUND THE RIVET ABOUT FORTY TIMES AND IT WOULD PICK UP THE LITTLE METALLIC WASHERS
UM YES THERE WAS THE MORE TIMES YOU WRAP THE WIRE AROUND THE RIVET <BREATH> THE MORE POWER IT WOULD HAVE AGAINST
YEAH THAT'S CORRECT
WELL WE USED ELECTRICITY TO POWER THE WE USED THE ELECTRICITY TO POWER THE STEEL RIVET AND WE AND WE ALSO USED MAGNETISM TO MAKE THE STEEL RIVET PICK UP ALL THE WASHERS
YES THAT IS RIGHT
AND THEY BOTH WORKWITH EACH OTHER
YOU'RE WELCOME
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WELL IF YOU WRAPPED WELL THE MORE TIMES YOU WRAPPED THE WELL MORE TIMES YOU WRAP THE WIRE ABOUT AROUND THE RIVET THEN IT WOULD THEN THERE WOULD BE SOME MORE POWER EACH TIME YOU WRAPPED IT AROUND
YES WITHOUT ANY ELECTRICITY THE RIVET CANNOT BE USED AS A MAGNET
WELL IF YOU WRAPPED UM WELL THE MORE TIMES YOU WRAPPED UM A A WIRE AROUND THE RIVET IF WE HAD TO WRAP IT ARO ABOUT FORTY TIMES THEN IT WOULD HAVE MORE POWER IN PICKING UP THE WASHERS BE BECAUSE IT WOULD JUST HAVE SOME MORE POWER AGAINST FOR PICKING UP THE WASHERS
HI
WELL THE STEEL THE ELECTRICITY AND THE MAGNETISM BOTH SORT OF TEAMED UP TO PICK UP THE METAL WASHERS AND BECAUSE UM THE STEEL RIVET WITHOUT ANY ELECTRICITY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PICK UP THE THE WASHERS WITHOUT ANY ELECTRICITY SO THEY BOTH TEAMED UP TOGETHER TO PICK UP THE WASHERS
WELL WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRICITY AND BEFORE ELECTRICITY WE WERE LEARNING <BREATH> AROU- ABOUT THE MAGNETISM ABOUT MAGNETISM AND TODAY WE LEARNED ABOUT MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY AT THE SAME TIME
WELL THE SWITCH TURNED ON AND WHEN THE SWITCH IS TURNED ON THE ELECTRICITY CAN FLOW AND AND THE WHEN THE ELECTRICITY WAS ON THEN THE WHEN THE ELECTRICITY SWITCH WAS ON THEN THE STEEL RIVET COULD <BREATH> COULD WORK AND PICK UP SOME OF THE ME METAL WASHERS
THIS IS HOW THE THIS IS HOW THE UM STEEL RIVET IS GOING TO PICK UP ALL OF THE WASHERS AND IT WILL HAVE ELECTRICITY WORKING BECAUSE IT IS CONNECTED TO A BATTERY AND AN ON AND OFF SWITCH AND IF YOU TURN THE ON AND OFF SWITCH ON THEN IT WOULD BE ABLE TO PICK UP ALL OF THE OR MOST OF THE OR SOME OF THE WASHERS
WELL SO TODAY WE WE WE DID ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM AND WE MADE THE AND WE MADE ELEC- AND WE HAD ELECTRICITY <BREATH> HELP LIKE HELP PICK UP SOME <BREATH> WE HAD WE USE ELECTRICITY TO HELP A STEEL RIVET PICK UP <BREATH> UM SOME WASHERS AND WE USED MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY
YES
THE METAL WASHERS
AND A ST I MEAN A MAGNET ONLY STICKS TO <BREATH> A MAGNET ONLY STICKS TO UM ANYTHING THAT'S MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
WELL A MAGNET IS MADE OF ANYTHING IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
THE MAGNET IS MOVING BECAUSE THESE TWO MAGNETS MUST HAVE A VERY STRONG FORCE OF ATTRACTION <BREATH> AND IT HAS TO BE SOME HIGH FORCE OF ATTRACTION FOR THE TWO MAGNET
YES THAT IS CORRECT
YES THEY WOULD
UM I FORGOT THE NAME WA OF WHAT'S HAPPENING
UM THEY'RE
THEN IT STICKS TO ANY STEEL M TO ANY STEEL OR IRON <BREATH> MADE OBJECT
NO BECAUSE A SPONGE IS NOT MADE OF STEEL OR IRON
I DIDN'T
WELL IN THIS SCENE THERE ARE A LOT OF THERE ARE A LOT OF OBJECTS AND THE MAGNET WILL ONLY STICK TO A FEW OF THE OBJECT TO A FEW OF THE OBJECTS
THE MAGNETS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THIS PICTURE ARE S WILL STICK TO EACH OTHER OR ATTRACT TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE THE NORTH AND SOUTH POLES ARE FACING EACH OTHER
UM YES THE MAGNETS BOTH MUST HAVE A STRONG FORCE OF ATTRACTION
UM THE NAIL THE MAGNET AND THE AND THE PAPER CLIP ARE SHOWING FORCE OF ATTRACTION
MMM NO NOT EXACTLY BUT WE DID PROJECTS SIMILAR TO THIS
WELL THE STEEL WIRE SCREEN IS STICKING TO THE MAGNET AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
GOOD
UM WELL THE WELL OTHER THINGS IN THE PICTURE ARE A SPONGE A WASHER A PAPER HOLDER A PAPER CLIP UM TWO ROCKS A CRAFT STICK TWO NAILS <BREATH> UM A BIT OF A PLASTIC STRAW A SPONGE AND THAT'S ALL
BO UM THE <BREATH>
YES IT IS BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
UM SO THE NE SO THE MAGNET IS STICKING TO A NAIL AND THE NAIL IS STICKING TO A PAPER CLIP
YES IT DOES
OKAY GOODBYE THANK YOU
WELL UM IT CAN STICK TO MOST STEEL AND IRON OBJECTS BUT SOME OBJECTS IT CANNOT STICK TO SO PART TIME IT IS
YES
WELL THE MA I THINK THAT THE MAGNET WILL STICK TO THE STEEL WIRE SCREEN THE THE DARK COLORED NAIL THE PAPER CLIP THE WASHER AND THAT'S ALL
WELL IN THE PICTURE THERE'S A SPONGE UM A STRAW A NAIL AND A UM A <BREATH> THERE'S A CRAFT STICK A GRANITE ROCK UM <BREATH> UM ANOTHER NAIL A ROCK OR UM A WIRE SCREEN A PAPER CLIP AND A PAPER HOLDER
THANK YOU
ATTRACT
UM YES THAT IS CORRECT <FP> TO UM ON TWO MAGNETS IF YOU HAVE A NORTH POLE AND A SOUTH POLE <BREATH> THEN THIS MEANS THAT THE TWO MAGNETS WILL ATTRACT TO EACH O
WELL AS YOU CAN SEE THE THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION IS UM IS VERY STRONG IN THIS PICTURE BECAUSE UM THE FORCE OF N OF THESE TWO MAGNETS IS GOING THROUGH THE THIN UM <FP> THE THIN PIECE OF PAPER OR THE THIN OBJECT
THANK YOU
UM YES IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT A PAPER CLIP IS MADE OF IRON OR STEEL
WELL THE TWO NORTH AND SOUTH POLES ARE FACING EACH OTHER SO THAT MEANS AS I TOLD YOU THE NORTH AND SOUTH POLES STICK TO EACH OTHER <BREATH> OR ATTRACT SO IT WILL ATTRACT
AND A MAGNET
YES THEY ARE
UM THE ATTRACTION FORCE IS WHERE THE THE TWO N NORTH AND SOUTH POLES ATTRACT TO EACH OTH-
WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION AND FORCE OF REPULSION AND THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION IS WHEN TWO TWO MAGNETS UM STICK TOGETHER AND THE FORCE OF REPULSION IS WHEN TWO MAGNETS REPULSE FROM EACH O
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON MAGNETISM
<FP> THERE ARE TWO THINGS ON A MAGNET CALLED NORTH AND SOUTH POLES <BREATH> AND WHEN THERE ARE TWO NORTH AND SOUTH POLES THEN THEY CONNECT TO EACH OTHER BUT WHEN THERE ARE TWO NORTH POLES OR TWO SOUTH POLES THEY REPULSE E FROM EACH OTHER
UM NO WE HAVE NOT WORKED ON LIGHT BULBS YET
IT IS AN EARTH IT IS THE EARTH AND THAT IS A SYSTEM
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT QUESTION
THEY MAKE OTHER THINGS HAPPEN
I THINK THEY REPRESENT JUNGLES DESERTS BODIES OF WATER AND ICE
IT SHOWS THE MUSCLES
IS A SYSTEM AND WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS
WEBS MEANS THAT IT SHOWS WHAT ANIMALS ARE EATING AND HOW AND WHAT THEY EAT AND WHAT THEY WHAT EATS THEM
IT HELPS BY MAKING SOMETHING HAPPEN WITH INVOLVING THE SYSTEM
CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION
PLANTS AND ANIMALS
I THINK IT IS MADE OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS
THOSE ARE THE WHEELS AND THEY MAKE THE CAR MOVE
OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY HIGHLIGHT
I SEE THAT IT WHEN I HOVERED OVER THE TOP OF AFRICA IT BROUGHT UP DESERT
EARTH LUGGAGE COMPUTERS CARS UM THE HUMAN BODY AND THE UNIVERSE
I SEE AN OCEAN HOUSES MOUNTAINS CLOUDS AND TREES
IT IS TELLING ME WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY IF THEY ARE A CONSUMER OR IF THEY ARE A A DECOMPOSER
THEY CAN I DON'T KNOW
WHAT UM THINGS EAT AND WHAT EAT THEM
SYSTEM
A PERSON
SO I THINK IT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY INTERACTING PARTS INVOLVING ANIMALS PEOPLE AND OTHER THINGS
IT HAS MANY THINGS INSIDE OF IT
THE INTERACTING PARTS IN IN IT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASKING
I NOTICE THAT THEY ALL LEAD UP TO BACTERIA AND MUSHROOMS THINGS THAT DON'T EAT BUT THE EAT BUT THEY DO THEY DO EAT BUT THEY I SAID THAT WRONG THEY THEY'RE BEING EATEN SO THAT THEY ONLY EAT ONE SPECIFIC THING
I SEE WHEELS A I SEE WHEELS AND THEY MAKE THE CAR MOVE I SEE A SEAT AND THAT IS WHERE PEOPLE CAN SIT ON AND I SEE A WHEEL AND THAT CONTROLS WHERE YOU DRIVE HOW YOU DRIVE AND WHICH WAY YOU GO
IT HELP IT SAYS THAT IT IT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN A SYSTEM
IT IS SHOWING FOOD WEBS AND I CLICKED ON THE ON THE TUNDRA THE ICY AREAS AND IT IS SHOWING WHAT PEOPLE WHAT ANIMALS AND WHAT ANIMALS EAT IN A FOOD WEB
EARTH AND THE UNIVERSE
UM THERE ARE ECOSYSTEMS AND UM I FORGET THE REST
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS
THAT THE HUMAN BODY IS A SYSTEM
<SILENCE>
THE PRODUCERS MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS THE CONSUMERS EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS AND THE DECOMPOSERS EAT DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS
I THINK THAT THIS FOX IS A CARNIVORE
<SILENCE>
THEY ARE ALL PART OF THE OF A BIG SYSTEM
A HAWK
A DECOMPOSER
HOW ARE YOU
THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS
THEY MAKE COMPOST SO THAT GARDENS AND OTHER PLANTS CAN GROW
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS
BACTERIA IS A DECOMPOSER
A DECOMPOSER EATS DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS
I THINK THAT A BEAR IS AN OMNIVORE BECAUSE THEY EAT BOTH PLANTS AND ANIMALS
IT MAKES THEM PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE TO EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS TO SURVIVE
THEY ARE WORMS THEY ARE DECOMPOSERS AND THEY MAKE COMPOST FOR GARDENS AND PLANTS
I THINK THAT A MOOSE IS A HERBIVORE
THE BUG THE BIRD THE HAWK THE SNAKE THE BUNNY AND THE SALAMANDER
A RED WORM IS A DECOMPOSER
IT IS TELLING ME WHAT
TO BE A CARNIVORE MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT MEAT AND NO PLANT
IT MEANS TO BE A CONSUMER THAT YOU EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS TO SURVIVE
SOME OF THOSE CONSUMERS ONLY EAT MEAT SOME OF THEM ONLY EAT PLANTS SOME OF THEM EAT BOTH AND SOME OF THEM EAT DECAYING MATTER I THINK
THEY ARE PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS
IT CONNECTS TO BEING A CARNIVORE BECAUSE THEY ONLY EAT MEAT
THE GRASS AND THE PINECONE
YEAH A CONSUMER
TO BE A DECOMPOSER MEANS THAT YOU MAKE OTHER YOU MAKE THINGS FOR OTHER LIVING (()) FOR OTHER LIVING THINGS LIKE COMPOST
THE PRODUCERS MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS THE CONSUMERS EAT OTHER LIVING THINGS AND THE DECOMPOSERS EAT DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS SO THE WORLD WON'T BE AS MESSY
THAT THEY ARE NEITHER A HERBIVORE A CARNIVORE NOR A OMNIVORE
BEING AN HERBIVORE MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT PLANTS
THEY MAKE THEIR ENERGY BY EATING OTHER LIVING THINGS
THERE WE GO THE MUSHROOMS
<DISCARD>
THE BLUE PART IS THE CELLS AND THE RED PART THAT THE BLOOD IS GOING THROUGH IS THE CAPILLARY
<DISCARD>
<DISCARD>
THAT IS ABOUT THE AIR GOING INTO THE BODY AND GOING OUT
I THINK THAT THE HEART PUMPS BLOOD THROUGHOUT YOUR BODY SO THAT YOU CAN BREATHE
IT IS THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
THAT IS OUR HEART AND SOME OF OUR BLOOD IS GOING INTO OUR HEART AND SOME OF IT IS GOING OUT
THE DOG'S CIRCULATORY SYSTEM AND THE HUMAN'S CIRCULATORY SYSTEM ARE DIFFERENT BUT ALMOST THE SAME
THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT BREATHING
B IS THE HEART
AIR COMES INTO THE BODY BY THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE
BLOOD GOES THROUGH BLOOD VESSELS AND GOES INTO THE HEART AND IT GOES OUT OF THE HEART
I THINK THAT BLOOD GOES INTO THE HEART SOME BLOOD GOES INTO THE HEART AND SOME BLOOD COMES OUT OF THE HEART
I SEE O TWO H TWO O COMING GOING OUT OF THE
GOOD HOW ARE GOOD HOW ARE YOU
A IS THE BLOOD VESSELS B IS THE HEART AND THE AND THE AND C IS THE BLOOD STREAM
LUNGS AND YES IT IS IN THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
C O TWO IS BEING BROUGHT INTO THE SYSTEM AND H TWO O AND O TWO IS GOING OUT INTO THE CELLS
THE DIAPHRAGM THE DIAPHRAGM
A IS THE BLOOD VESSELS
THE BLUE PART IS THE CELLS AND THE RED PART THAT THE BLOOD IS GOING THROUGH IS THE CAPILLARIES
SOMETHING
C IS THE BLOOD AND IT IS THE BLOOD STREAM WHERE THE BLOOD GOES AND WHERE IT COMES FROM
THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM IS HOW YOU BREATHE
<DISCARD>
<DISCARD>
THAT IS WHERE YOU CHEW YOUR FOOD TO HELP IT GO DOWN YOUR GO DOWN TO YOUR ESOPHAGUS AND INTO YOUR STOMACH AND THEN INTO YOUR INTESTINES THAT YOU CAN GET IT BACK OUT
THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IS ALL ABOUT BREAKING DOWN YOUR FOOD SO YOU CAN SWALLOW IT AND GET IT BACK OUT OF YOUR BODY
SKIN CELLS HELP YOU BODY HELP CUTS AND THINGS
WE BOTH HAVE A DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
THE CELLS IN THE HUMAN ARE ALL BUNCHED TOGETHER AND IT IS THE ENTIRE BODY AND THE LEAF CELL IS JUST ONE PART
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT YEAST IS A SINGLE CELL WHILE THE WHILE THE HUMAN BODY AND PLANTS HAVE MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF CELLS
THE PLANT HAS MANY MANY CELLS INSIDE OF IT
<DISCARD>
IT IS SHOWING THE BUTTERFLY'S DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND THE HUMAN'S DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
THE INTESTINES IS WHERE YOUR FOOD GO COMES FROM YOUR STOMACH AND IT GOES INTO YOUR INTESTINES TO HELP IT BREAK DOWN EVEN MORE SO THAT IT CAN GET OUT OF YOUR ANUS
THAT IT IS PINK
THEY TRAVEL THE FOOD TO HELP IT GET OUT
<DISCARD>
IT HELP GETS THE FOOD THAT YOU'VE THAT YOU CHEWED UP WITH YOUR TEETH AND SALIVA INTO ANOTHER PART OF YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
YOU NEED MUSCLES
THERE ARE MANY BRAIN CELLS THAT ARE BLUE
IT IS SHOWING US WHERE THE MOUTH IS
THAT IS WHERE YOU WHERE THE FOOD IS STORED UNTIL IT GOES INTO THE INTESTINES
THAT ALL THE BIG BALLS OF BLUE ARE BRAIN CELLS
THIS IS SHOWING US MANY PARTS OF THE BODY LIKE THE INTESTINES AND THE LUNG
THE CELLS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THAN EACH OTHER
THAT HUMANS HAVE A LOT MORE PARTS TO THE TO THE BODY THAN YEAST DOES
<DISCARD>
THE ESOPHAGUS' THE ESOPHAGUS GET THE FOOD DOWN THAT YOU BROKE DOWN FROM YOUR MOUTH AND IT GET IT GETS IT DOWN INTO YOUR STOMACH
THE BUTTERFLY HAS CELLS IN ITS BODY AND IN ITS WINGS
MANY BLUE CELLS THAT LOOK LIKE SKIN
CELLS
(())
CAUSE THEY NEED TO BE THEY NEED TO SURVIVE AND THEY NEED TO GROW
THE PLANT HAS NOT BEEN GETTING ANY AIR SO IT STARTED TO DIE
BECAUSE IT HAS EVERYTHING LIKE SUN AIR AND WATER
THE FULL ANIMAL CRACKER IS NOT A I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY SO YOU TELL ME
PLANTS NEED SUN TO SURVIVE AND THIS AND SINCE THE SUN HASN'T BEEN OUT IT MADE IT MADE THE PLANT WILT
I THINK THAT THE YEAST WAS IN IT'S DORMANT STAGE AND THE COOKIE WAS NUTRIENTS TO HELP IT BECOME OUT OF IT'S DORMANT STAGE AND THE WATER WAS ALSO NUTRIENTS
IT CONNECTS TO FOOD WEBS BY THE THE PLANT'S MAKING THEIR OWN FOOD SO THAT OTHER THINGS OTHER LIVING THINGS CAN EAT THEM AND THEN AND THEN AND YEAH
ONE OF THE PLANTS IS IN ITS DORMANT STAGE AND THAT IS WHERE IT IS NOT FULLY GROWN AND IT IS NOT EXACTLY HEALTHY AND ONE IS OUT OF ITS DORMANT STAGE WHERE IT IS FULLY GROWN HEALTHY AND NOT DEAD
THE PLANTS NEED EVERYTHING INCLUDING SUN AIR AND WATER TO SURVIVE IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY WILL DIE AND WILT
THE PLANT NEEDS NUTRIENTS TO SURVIVE AS WELL
THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS
THE PICTURE AND THE HOUSE AND THAT IS THAT PLANTS CAN BE INDOORS BUT THEY ARE PREFERABLY SUPPOSED TO BE OUTSIDE
SUNLIGHT WATER AND SOIL
THAT IS SOMETHING
BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS IN ITS DORMANT STAGE
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT YEAST NEEDING NUTRIENTS AND PRODUCE AND PLANTS NEEDING SUNLIGHT AIR AND WATER TO MAKE TO LIVE AND SURVIVE AND THEY AND PLANTS MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS
YEAST IS A FUNGUS
YES
IT IS SHOWING US THAT IF YOU WATER A PLANT THAT THAT HELPS THE PLANT GROW
THAT IS WIND THE PICTURE OF THE CLOUD IS WIND AND IF THE WIND IS TOO HEAVY THE PLANTS WILL DIE
THE SUN IS SUNLIGHT AND THE PLANTS NEED SUNLIGHT TO SURVIVE
TOO MUCH SUN HAS BEEN GOING ON SO IT MADE THE PLANT WILT
THIS PLANT HAS GOTTEN EVERYTHING INCLUDING SUN AIR AND WATER SO IS SO IT IS GROWN AND SURVIVED AND IT IS NOT DYING IT IS GOOD
I THINK THAT THAT IS ABOUT YEAST HAVING TO HAVE NUTRIENTS TO BECOME OUT TO GET OUT OF ITS DORMANT STAGE BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE SOME SOME KIND OF NUTRIENTS LIKE ANIMAL CRACKERS WHICH HAS TWO MAIN INGREDIENTS THAT IT NEEDS TO BECOME OUT OF IT OUT OF IT'S DORMANCY
I THINK THAT ITS BASIC NEEDS ARE THAT WHEN THE WATER GOES UP THROUGH THE ROOTS THAT HELPS THE PLANTS GROW AND WITH THE LIGHT ENERGY GOES ONTO THE PLANT IT ALSO HELPS IT GROW AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE THAT IS WHAT THE PLANT BREATHES IN AND THE OXYGEN GOES OUT SO THAT WE CAN BREATHE
I DON'T KNOW
THE PLANT GOT SUN AND AIR BUT IT GOT NO WATER SO IT STARTED TO DIE
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS
PRODUCERS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THEY WEREN'T THERE THEN SOME ANIMALS WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO EAT AND THEY WOULD DIE
NO I DO NOT THINK THEY KNOW HOW TO CATCH A FRISBEE WHEN THEY
IT IS A NONLEARNED BEHAVIOR
THAT IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR
THIS IS A NONLEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT IMMEDIATELY SO BAD
BECAUSE IT THEY CAN FLAP THEIR WINGS AND GET THE (()) AWAY
IT IS INVOLVING A SKUNK WHICH IS FOOD FOR THE WOLF
IT'S WINGS FOR THAT IT CAN FLY AWAY
NO I DON'T THINK IT IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR IT JUST HAPPENS
AN ADAPTATION THAT THE SKUNK HAS IS ITS SMELL THAT MAKES THE SKUNK RUN AWAY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WANT TO SMELL THAT
IT CAN DEFEND ITSELF FROM PREDATOR
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
THE SNAKE HAS AN ADAPTATION ABOUT IT'S RATTLE AND IT'S SOUND THAT MAKES THE GIRL SCARED AND RUN AWAY
WHAT DOES CLASSIFIED MEAN
IT'S ADAPT ONE OF ITS ADAPTATION IS ITS SHELL CAUSE IT CAN HELP IT SURVIVE FROM PREDATOR
THERE'RE ANIMALS AND THEY ALL HAVE DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS
THE RATTLE IS THE ADAPTATION BECAUSE THE RATTLE SCARES THE GIRL WHICH IS THE IT'S STIMULUS
THE SKUNK IS
NUMBER TWO IT'S WEBBED FEET
IT IS SHOWING THAT THE BIRDS ARE FLYING AND THE ONE IN THE FRONT IS THE LEADER
NUMBER TWO IT'S TEETH
WE HAVEN'T BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ANIMALS YET
THE PERSON TOUCHES THE HOT OVEN THAT AND IT MAKES IT GO AND IT MAKES IT MAKES THE PERSON MAKES THE PERSON'S HAND GO UP BECAUSE IT IS SO HOT
ONE OF ITS ADAPTATION IS ITS PATTERN ON ITS BACK AND ON ITS BODY SO IT CAN BE CAMOUFLAGED IN WITH ITS HABITAT
I THINK IT'S BEHAVIOR IS THAT THE THAT THE DUCKS ARE GETTING TOO COLD SO THEY WANT TO GO TO A WARMER PLACE FOR THE (())
THE CAT FELL OUT OF THE TREE
THE ONE IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER IS THE PERSON IS TOUCHING THE HOT OVEN WHICH MAKES THE WHICH IS A STIMULUS TO THE GIRL TO THE PERSON MAKING IT MAKING IT GO UP IMMEDIATELY CAUSE IT IS SO HOT AND THE ONE IN THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER IS (())
IT'S BEHAVIOR IS PLAYING BECAUSE IT IS HAPPY TO BE CATCHING THE DISC
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
THIS BEHAVIOR IS A PERSON AND A DOCTOR AND THE DOCTOR IS HITTING THEIR KNEE TO SHOW THAT TO SEE THEIR THEIR REFLECTION
WHAT'S AN ADAPTATION
ONE IS THE SPINAL CORD AND THERE IS THE BRAIN AND
IT RAN AWAY BECAUSE IT WAS SCARED THAT THE RATTLE SNAKE WAS GOING TO TO EAT IT
THE BRAIN HELPS BY IT BY SHOWING THE PERSON BY TELLING THE PERSON WHAT THEIR THINKING ABOUT DOING AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS AND THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
THIS IS SHOWING US THAT THE BRAIN HAS A BIG PART BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT SHE WANTS TO HIT THE BALL AND HER BODY IS GETTING READY TO HIT
NO
I DON'T KNOW
THE DOG IS SITTING THE D IS COLLECTING POLLEN AND THE GEESE ARE FLYING
IT'S ABOUT A BOY BE TALKING AND THEN HE SPILLS OVER THE GRAPE JUICE AND THE STIMULUS IS THAT THE GRAPE JUICE STARTLED THE BOY SO HE JUMPED UP
IT SLAPS THE MOSQUITO BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WANT TO BE HURT
THE DOG THE DOORBELL RINGS AND THE STIMULUS IS THAT THE DOG BARKED
IT SHOWS THAT ONE BEE WANTS OTHER BEES TO DO THINGS BECAUSE THEY NEED MORE OF SOMETHING
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT ANIMAL BEHAVIORS HOW THEY WORK HOW HOW THE HOW STIMULATES HAPPEN AND MAKES ANIMALS DO THINGS AND ALSO HUMAN
THE MOSQUITO WANTS TO SUCK THE PERSON'S BLOOD BUT THE BUT THE SAME PERSON SMACKS IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WANT IT'S BLOOD BEING SUCKED BY A MOSQUITO
IT MAKES IT BARK
THAT IS THE HUMAN BODY
THE SQUIRREL COMES UP TO THE SNAKE AND THE RATTLESNAKE HISSES BECAUSE IT WANTS TO EAT THE SQUIRREL BUT THE SQUIRREL DOESN'T WANT TO BE EATEN SO IT RUNS AWAY
ONCE THE DOORBELL RANG THE DOG BARKED BECAUSE IT WANTED TO PROTECT IT'S IT'S MASTER
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
IT IS SHOWING THAT THE B IS COLLECTING POLLEN AND IT IS BRINGING POLLEN BACK TO THE HONEY COMB
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MAKES PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE EITHER STARTLED OR THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING
IT IS A HUMAN BODY
THE BLOOD KEEPS GOING AND THE C O TWO THAT IT THAT IS FROM THE HEART GOES OUT INTO THE ALVEOLIS AND THE AND THE O TWO GOES INTO THE BLOOD SO THAT IT CAN KEEP GOING THROUGH THE BLOOD STREAM AND IT GOES BACK INTO THE HEART SO THAT THE BLOOD FROM THE O TWO CAN GO INTO THE HEART AND YEAH
<DISCARD>
(())
THE TRACHEA
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
THERE ARE TUBES THAT CARRY AIR AND BRANCH OFF THE TRACHEA AND GO DEEP INTO THE LUNG
THIS IS TELLING YOU PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY AND THE
BREATHING IS ALL ABOUT LIVING YOU HAVE TO BREATHE TO BE ABLE TO LIVE
THIS IS ABOUT AIR GOING INTO YOUR BODY AND GOING INTO THE LUNGS AND THEN GOING BACK OUT SO THAT YOU CAN BREATHE
<DISCARD>
THE EXCHANGE OF GASES IS ALL ABOUT C O TWO GOING OUT INTO YOUR BODY BECAUSE YOUR BODY CAN NOT USE THAT BUT O TWO COMES IN BECAUSE YOU NEED THAT TO BREATHE
I DON'T KNOW
E BECAUSE I BECAUSE IT IS LUNGS
<DISCARD>
I DON'T KNOW
LUNGS
I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
AIR GETS TAKEN INTO THE BODY BY WHEN YOU INHALE IT FROM YOUR MOUTH AND FROM YOUR NOSE
AIR COMES INTO THE BODY THROUGH THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND YOUR MOUTH
YOU HELP PLANTS GROW
THE GRASS AND THE PINECONE
ABOUT SYSTEMS
A DECOMPOSER
IT HELPS PLANTS GROW
CONSUMER IS WHEN WHATEVER THE CONSUMER IS IS WHAT IT EATS THINGS
NO
I THINK A DECOMPOSER IS
HELLO
CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION
IT TELLS ME THAT THEY MAKE OTHER THEY MAKE THINGS FOR THE EARTH THAT HELP IT GROW
THEY DO NOT EAT ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD
A HERBIVORE ONLY EATS PLANTS
A CARNIVORE
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE SYSTEMS WHICH ARE LIKE ANIMALS THINGS OR BACTERIA
BECAUSE IF THEY WERE NOT EXISTING THEN EVERY PLANT AND ANIMAL WOULD TAKE FOREVER TO BE DEAD FULLY AND NOT BE IN THE WORLD AND IF THEY WERE THEN THE WORLD WOULD BE A VERY VERY VERY DIRTY PLACE
IS A DECOMPOSER AND IT MAKES THINGS FOR THE EARTH
(()) CONSUMERS AND DECOMPOSERS
SOME OF THEM ONLY EAT MEAT SOME OF THEM ONLY EAT GRASS SOME OF THEM EAT BOTH
THEY ARE EATING THEY THEY'LL DEAD LEAVES AND THE NEWSPAPERS TO MAKE THEM COMPOST
SOME OF THE ANIMALS LIKE THE SHARK EATS SOME OF THE OTHER ANIMALS THAT ARE IN THE
IT IS A FOOD CHAIN OF MANY DIFFERENT
DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS
THEY ARE ALL SYSTEMS
A PLANT BREATHES IN C TWO O WHICH IS WHAT WE BREATHE OUT AND THEY BREATHE OUT AIR WHICH IS WHAT WE BREATHE IN
<SILENCE>
THEY EAT OTHER LIVING THING
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASK
THEY MAKE THEY MAKE STUFF THAT YOU PUT IN GARDENS TO HELP YOUR PLANTS GROW
A DECOMPOSER IT MAKES IT EATS SOLID BAD THINGS I THINK
THINK THAT AN OMNIVORE MEANS YOU EAT PLANTS AND ANIMALS
DEAD PLANTS AND ANIMALS
<DISCARD>
WORMS DECOMPOSE IT AND MAKE IT COMPOST
CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION
IT IS A HERBIVORE
DECOMPOSERS
I THINK HE IS A A COMPOSER
A PRODUCER MEANS THAT IT GIVES HUMANS OR OTHER LIVING ORGANISMS THINGS TO BREATHE AND EAT
HELLO
GOOD
<BREATH> WE WERE MAKING SOME AIRPLANES AND WE AND WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE SURE WHAT HA HA THE DISTANCE WAS FOR THE AIRPLANE
YES MY PLANE FLEW IN A DIFFERENT DIF- DIFFERENT UM DISTANCES
<BREATH> IT UM YOU HAVE YOU'RE TRYING TO START PROPELLER AND WHEN YOU LET GO THE THE AIRPLANE WILL GO AND WHEN IT STOPS STARTS THE NUMBER OF THE DISTANCE
GOOD
THEY WORK TOGETHER BY UM BY TWISTING THE RUBBERBAND AND HOW YOU DO THAT IS YOU TURN TURN THE PROPELLER CLOCKWISE FOR A TWENTY FOUR TIMES AND THEN YOU JUST LET GO AND THEN THE THE AIRPLANE WILL JUST GO AND GO GO FORWARD
THE THE AIRPLANE IS GOING UP THE LINE IT'S RIDING
UM THE AIRPLANE IS GOING UP THE LINE AND IT IS IT IS JUST GOING UP THE LINE
UM THE PROPELLER AND RUBBERBAND TWO POPSICLE STICKS AND TWO JUMBO STRAWS AND ONE AND ANOTHER STRAW
HELLO
YES
UM ONE SIDE IS DOWN MORE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THE OTHER SIDE IS A LITTLE BIT UPPER
I'VE GOT THERE IS UM A PROPELLER AND THAT TWISTS THE THE RUBBERBAND THAT WHICH IS ON THE BOTTOM AND THERE ARE TWO POPSICLE STICKS ON BOTH SIDES UM AND THERE THERE IS TWO JUMBO STRAWS SQUEEZED TOGETHER THROUGH SQUEEZED THROUGH THE TWO POPSICLE STICKS AND ON TOP IS A RUBBER STRAW THAT GOES AND AS THE ST THE FISHING LINE GOES THROUGH THE STRAW
UM WELL UM THE FLIGHT LINE IS SO THAT SO THE UM AIRPLANE CAN MOVE ON TO ANYTHING
CAUSE FOR PAPERCLIPS WHICH IS THE PASSENGERS ARE MAKING THE AIRPLANE GO SLOWER CAUSE UM THE MORE PASSENGERS THERE ARE THE UM MORE SLOWER IT GETS
S TIME AND
S HOW MANY SWINGS IT WAS
WHAT WAS IT AGAIN
GOOD
WE DID
WE'VE BEEN MAKING AIRPLANES AND EVERYTHING
IT'S SWINGING
THERE ARE TWENTY SWINGS AND THAT IS AND THAT SWINGS IS ABOUT TWENTY CENTIMETERS
YES WE HAD GRAPHS ABOUT PENDULUMS
THE ON THE LEFT SIDE UM
THANK YOU
YES
NO
IS THE NUMBER OF
NO
IT WAS ABOUT LIKE TWELVE OR NINE
OKAY
YES
A TWENTY PENDULUM MMM HA IS FIFTEEN
A LOT
THE NUMBER OF SWINGS AND THE PENDULUM NA LENGTHS AND IS
WE WERE SWINGING THEM AROUND AND COUNTING AND COUNTING UM HOW LONG THEY SWUNG
IT'S SO GOOD
SEVEN
BYE MI
A LITTLE BIT
THE THE LITTLE ONE IS BOUNCING OFF THE WALL AND
WE GOT TO UM <BREATH> WE GOT TO UM MEASURE THE DISTANCES THE CORK FLEW
YEP
KIDS OR SOMEBODY IS MEASURING HOW FAR THE THE THE ITEM UM IS GOING WHICH IS FORTY CENTIMETERS
IS
BACK
JUST A LITTLE BIT <BREATH>
A CORK AND YEAH
YES
AND OH AND WE ALSO MEASURED HOW HOW LONG IT HOW LONG THE DISTANCES WAS
I CAN'T REALLY EXPLAIN IT IT'S HARD
I MADE A I CAN HEAR MYSELF
WELL I THINK THE
GOOD
SO UM <BREATH> THE METER STICK IS STANDING UP AND THE FLIP
AND THE BIG ONE IS IS BOUNCING OFF THE WALL AND ON TO THE GROUND
THE ITEM AND IT'S MEASURING HOW FAR UP IT'S FLIPPING
THE PLANE
IT KEPT IT UM IT WENT IT WENT IN CIRCLES CAUSE TO MOVE M MOVE THE AIR
YES
WELL WE WHAT WE DID WAS JUST MAKING THE PLANE BUT WE DIDN'T GET TO FINISH IT
WHAT
FIRST THE AIRPLANE AND WE'RE MAKING AND WE WERE MAKING HIM SOME BOATS
A LITTLE PADDLE THING FOR THE WIND THING FOR THE FRONT
DON'T REALLY KNOW CAUSE I HAVEN'T UM UH TRIED IT YET
A FISHING LINE A POPS JUICE POPSICLE STICKS AND TWO STRAWS WHICH WE PUNCH HOLES IN AND
SYSTEM
I
WE HAD UM THAT'LL
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WE HAVEN'T TRIED THE PLANE YET
WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING YET
THE AIRPLANE IS GOING UP THE LINE
DIDN'T FINISH IT
HELLO
THE RUBBER BAND IS ON THE BOTTOM UM AND UM SO THAT THE IT COULD HOLD THE THE LITTLE PADDLE THING AND I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
GOOD
IT MOVES THE PLANE
THE MORE CAPACITY IT HAD THE MORE PASSENGERS IT COULD HOLD
FI
Y ONE THE Y AXIS IS WHERE YOU PUT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
THANK YOU
OKAY
WELL THIS IS THE WAY WE HAD DONE IT IN SCIENCE CLASS SO IT'S PRETTY FAMILIAR AND THAT MAKES IT UH FAMILIAR WITH I'M FAMILIAR WITH IT AND SO THEN IT WOULD HAVE
I MEAN FIVE DIFFERENT BOATS
CAN YOU HEAR ME
THE HIGHER THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT
UM WHAT
WE HAVE BEEN TESTING PLANES
GOOD
<BREATH> YOU CAN TELL HOW MUCH THINGS WOULD BE AND WHAT THEY WOULD BE ABOUT LIKE IF YOU LOOKED AT THIS GRAPH YOU COULD FIGURE OUT THAT LIKE ON THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS THIRTY WOULD BE ABOUT TWENTY OR EIGHTEEN AND THEN FORTY FIVE WOULD BE THIRTY FIVE AND SIXTY WOULD BE THIRTY FIVE TOO BUT THAT ONE DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE AND THEN ALSO THE EIGHTY ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO HOLD FORTY FIVE PASSENGERS
THE Y LINE WAS WHERE YOU PUT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS AND THE X LINE WAS WHERE WE
HELLO
IT IS SHOWING ON WHERE EACH CAPACITY GOES AND HOW MUCH PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD
WE TESTED HOW THE SIZE OF THE BOAT OR THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT MADE THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS GO UP
TWENTY FIVE IF THEY BOTH GET TWENTY FIVE PASSENGERS THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT
WE
WHY NOT
IS ANY ONE THERE
SORRY
<BREATH> THE MORE PASSENGERS THAT YOU PUT ON THAT YOU HAVE
RIGHT
VARIABLES AND THEN WE GRAPHED ABOUT THEM
AND THEY BOTH
THE HIGHER OR THE MORE PASSENGERS IT CAN CARRY
WE HAVEN'T LEARNED ABOUT THAT
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
MOSTLY THE STANDARD PROCEDURES ARE TO JUST MAKE A CONTROLLED EX EXPERIMENT AND CONTROL ALL THE VARIABLES THEN THEY'LL REALLY JUST HELP YOU
WE HAVE BEEN TESTING LIFEBOATS MADE OUT OF HALF A PAPER CUP
I DON'T REALLY KNOW CAUSE I WASN'T HERE ON THURSDAY SO I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE THING
IF YOU PUT IT IN ALL ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK EARLIER THAN USUAL
<BREATH> WHAT WE DID WAS SO WE MEASURED THE NUMBER THE CAPACITY OF IT DOING IN MILLILITERS AND THEN WE TESTED HOW MANY PENNIES IT COULD HOLD
IF YOU HAVE A BIGGER BOAT YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA BE ABLE TO HOLD MORE MAYBE IF YOU CHANGED THE MATERIAL A BIT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HOLD MORE LIKE MAY BE IF YOU MADE IT OUT OF PLASTIC THAT FLOATS BETTER THAN PAPER SO MAYBE THAT WILL HOLD MORE AND MAYBE IF IT'S WIDER IT WILL HOLD MORE
KNOW WHICH ONE WAS VERY
THE EACH CUP
EACH OF THE <COUGH> EACH OF THE UM THINGS WHEN ALL THE PENNIES ADDED TOGETHER WENT JUST A LITTLE OVER THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE MILLILITERS LIKE ON NUMBER EIGHT ON EIGHTY MILLILITERS IT HAD FORTY FIVE PASSENGERS SO THAT GOES OVER THE HALF MARK
YOU ALREADY ASKED ME THAT QUESTION
RIGHT
THE BIGGER THE CAPACITY THE MORE UM PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD SO THAT PROBABLY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT
IF YOU PUT IT IN TOO HARD IT MIGHT SINK IT BEFORE IT'S GOOD AND ALSO
WE ONLY TESTED ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME AND WE TESTED THE SIZE OF THE BOAT
YOU MIGHT CHANGE THOSE S SOME OTHER TIME
IF YOU CHANGE TOO MANY AND THEN YOU GET A DIFFERENT RESULT YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE CAUSED THAT RESULT YOU JUST THINK OH I JUST GOT A DIFFERENT RESULT WHICH ONE DID IT
WE ARE TESTING FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF BOAT AND THEN WE'RE TESTING THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS EACH ONE CAN HOLD AND THEN WE'RE DOING GRAPHING A WE DID GRAPHING TODAY I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE DID ON THURSDAY CAUSE I WASN'T HERE
IF YOU CHANGE LIKE THE MATERIAL AND THE WIDTH AND THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT IT MIGHT JUST THROW IT OFF TOTALLY <COUGH>
BYE
YOU CAN MAKE IT HEAVIER OR LIGHTER OR MAKE IT A DIFFERENT COLOR
STRING IS HOLDING THE BOB AND THEN IT'S ATTACHED TO THE A PENCIL OR A WIRE OR SOMETHING THAT'S ATTACHED TO THE STRING AND THEN IT'S TIED TO THE PENDULUM OR TIED TO THE BOB
THE EIGHTEEN CENTIMETER WOULD <COUGH> WOULD MAKE IT GO A LOT QUICKER THE THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETER IS WHEN WE TESTED IT'S ABOUT A LITTLE QUICKER THAN A SECOND AND THE HUNDRED THE ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETER WOULD PROBABLY BE A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN THE UM WELL IT'D BE LONGER THAN A S SECOND CAUSE YOU'LL HAVE TO GO FARTHER UP AND THEN FARTHER DOWN
TIME IT DOESN'T GO AS FAR SO EVENTUALLY IT'LL BE LIKE A LOT FASTER THAN A SECOND
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PENDULUMS AND HOW TO KEEP TIME LIKE A GRANDFATHER CLOCK WOULD DO
THEY'RE ALL ABOUT KEEPING TIME SO THEY WOULD BE CONNECTED TO A POLE HAVE A PIECE OF STRING AND THEN A BOB WHICH IS A WEIGHT ON THE BOTTOM SO THEN IT WOULD MOVE SIDE TO SIDE HOPEFULLY EXACTLY THE TIME OF A SECOND
THE BOB
YES I DID
THIS IS WHAT A PENDULUM LOOKS LIKE THIS IS THE TYPE THAT WE MADE IN CLASS A FEW DAYS AGO
YOU CAN MAKE THE STRING LONGER OR SHORTER MAKE THE BOB HEAVIER OR LIGHTER MAKE THE UM THE HOLDER TILTED OR UP TILTED UP OR DOWN
IT GOES DOWN AND THEN COMES BACK A LITTLE BIT LOWER
GOOD
IT GOES BACK AND FORTH EVERY TIME IT HITS THE OPPOSITE SIDE IT COMES BACK
IT MOVES UH ALMOST THE EXACT TIME AS A SECOND GOES AND AFTER A WHILE IT STARTS TO SLOW DOWN
TO MAKE IT GO FASTER OR SLOWER
THE LIGHTER ONE WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT IT WOULD IT WOULD GO A LOT LONGER THAN THE HEAVIEST ONE CAUSE THE HEAVIEST ONE YOU HAVE MORE GRAVITY PULLING DOWN ON IT
UM SO LIKE IF YOU PUT THEM ALL ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD JUST SINK IT WOULD JUST LEAN TO THAT SIDE UNTIL IT WOULD JUST DIP IN TO THE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF WATER GETS IN AND THEN IT WOULD FILL UP AND F SINK AND IF YOU PUT IT ALL IN THE MIDDLE THEY MIGHT JUST STAY THERE AND NOT SINK THE BOAT UNTIL IT GETS TOO MUCH WEIGHT
T
MAYBE THE HIGHER IT IS THE MORE PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD CAUSE THEN THE WATER WOULD HAVE IT WOULD HAVE TO GO LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL A CERTAIN POINT AND THEN THE WATER WOULD FLOW OVER AND LIKE THE SMALLER IT IS THE LESS WEIGHT IT CAN HOLD
THERE WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH WEIGHT ON IT AND THEN IT WOULD ALSO JUST LIKE SINK AFTER LIKE FIVE PENNIES CAUSE THEY MIGHT ALL MOVE TO ONE SIDE SO THAT'S A BIG FACTOR OF IT
NOTHING
LIFEBOATS WE'RE MAKING THEM AND THEY'RE JUST A PAPER CUP SO WE CUT THEM IN HALF AND THEN WE PUT PENNIES IN 'EM TO SEE HOW MANY IT CAN PUT IN BEFORE IT STOPS UM FLOATING
NUMBER A COULD PROBABLY HOLD MORE CAUSE IT'S A LOT BIGGER NUMBER NUM- LETTER D COULD PROBABLY HOLD THE LEAST AMOUNT CAUSE IT'S THE SMALLEST AND THEREFORE IT WOULD HIT IT WOULD GO A LOT LESS TIME WITHOUT IT SINKING
THE MATERIALS IT'S MADE OUT OF THE HOW WIDE IT IS THE HEIGHT OF IT AND THE MATERIAL IT'S FLOATING IN LIKE WATER
IT WOULDN'T REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IF YOU'RE OFF AND THEN YOU TEST ANOTHER ONE THAT'S LIKE JUST A TEENY BIT OFF YOU MIGHT GET A DIFFERENT RESULT SO YOU WANT TO BE AS ACCURATE AS YOU CAN
THE MORE WEIGHT IT COULD TAKE CAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE SO THEN IT WOULD TAKE A LOT MORE TIME TO GET THE WATER OVER THE EDGE OF THE PAPER CUP
UM THE ONE ON NUMBER TWENTY THERE'S MORE OF THEM E BUT THEY'RE ALL IN THE MIDDLE SO IT'S SINKING IT A LOT MORE THAN NUMBER TWELVE WITH TWELVE OF THEM AND THEN THREE PENNIES CAUSE THEY'RE ALL SPREAD OUT THEY'RE NOT ALL IN ONE SPOT THEY'RE A LITTLE SPREAD OUT SO THEN IT SPREADS THE WEIGHT EVENLY AND WON'T FLIP OVER
PAPER CUPS
WE JUST STARTED YEAH WE JUST
CAUSE
TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWO OR PROBABLY ABOUT LIKE TWENTY ONE CENTIME TWENTY ONE PENNIES CAUSE THEN THERE'D BE A LOT LESS UM
WELL IF THERE ARE REALLY BIG WAVES IT WOULD UM LIKE FLIP THE BOAT MAYBE SO IT'S A LOT BETTER IF THERE'S JUST A LOT OF FLAT WATER
IF YOU PUT IT IN REALLY HARD YOU'D SINK THE BOAT
RIGHT
UM WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH FLIPPER BASE AND WE'RE SHOOTING FLIPPER BASES WE'RE SHOOTING UM THINGS
UM THE CIRCULAR BALL IS PROBABLY THE HEAVIEST CAUSE IT'S WOODEN SO IS THE WOODEN CORK BUT THE CORK IS A LITTLE LIGHTER THAN THE WOODEN BALL BOTH OF THEM ARE AND THEN THE FOIL THE THE MINI FOIL IS PROBABLY THE LIGHTEST THING
UM IT'S SHOWING HOW HIGH IT WENT WHICH IS ABOUT UH TWENTY EIGHT CENTIMETERS HIGH
IT WAS ON A PLASTIC ANGLE HOLDER
UM THEY'RE ALL THE SAME ANGLE AND THE OBJECT
IF YOU CHANGED MORE THAN ONE VARIABLE UM YOU YOU'LL YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE WOULD BE RIGHT SO YOU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT
UM WELL YOU CAN SEE WITH THE LARGE FOIL BALL IT'S IT'S LOWER DISTANCE IN LENGTH UM AND THEN THE SMALLER ONE IS HIGHER SO YOU WANT IT JUST PICK ONE OF THEM
UM ALL THE OTHER VARIABLES SHOULD STAY THE SAME YOU SHOULDN'T MESS WITH THEM CAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE TESTING JUST LIKE HOW FAR THE THINGS WILL GO NOT DIFFERENT WAYS
UH THEY'RE BOTH GOING THE SAME HEIGHT UH ONE CENTIMETER WITH THE STICK IN
UM THAT'S CHANGING MORE THAN ONE VARIABLE UM THAT'S YOU DON'T HAVE A C CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT WHICH THEN YOU DON'T KNOW THE ALMOST ALL THE EXACT THINGS
UM WHETHER THE FLIPPER BASE IS IS OVER HERE AND THEN IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ONCE THE STICK IS ONE CENTIMETER OUT UM AND IT SHOWS THE WAY IT LIKE WITH THE LINE THE WAY IT SHOT HOW HIGH AND HOW FAR AND IT SHOT FORTY CENTIMETERS
UM IT'S SHOWING THAT THE Y AXIS DECREASES UM AND THE X AXIS C INCREASE INCREASES AND THEN UM THE AND THEN IT SHOWS THE UH WHAT IS IT THE NE THE LIKE THE LINE ACROSS UH IT'S THEY SAY YOU CALL IT THE NEGATIVE
THIS PICTURE IS UM THAT THE THE TOP ONE IT'S I MEAN BOTH OF THEM ARE OUT LOOSE AT THE SAME LENGTH BUT THE CORK IS ON THE UM ON THE TOP OF AND THE CORK IS ON THE SECOND CENTIMETER IN BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THE SECOND AND THEN THE BOTTOM ONE IS IN WHERE THE CORK IS SUPPOSED TO BE
HI
UM WELL WE HEARD OF THE FLIPPER BASE AND AND THEN WE HAD THE FLIPPER S THE FLIPPER STICK WHICH WAS FLIPPING THE CORK AND THEN THE FLIPPER BASE WAS ON UM
THE BOTTOM ONE WILL PROBABLY GO FARTHER CAUSE IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND THEN THE TOP ONE WILL PROBABLY JUST GO A LITTLE WAYS
UM LET'S SEE IT THE ONE THAT THE ONE VARIABLE
UM THE CORKS WOULD PROBABLY GO THE SAME LENGTH THEN THE WOODEN BALL MIGHT GO THE FARTHEST CAUSE LIKE THE CORK'S CAN BOUNCE ANY WAY LIKE THEY COULD B BOUNCE BACK BUT THE C THE UM CIRCULAR BALL COULD JUST KEEP ON ROLLING FORWARD AND THEN SAME WITH BOTH OF THE FOIL BALLS
GOOD
YES IT DOES
BECAUSE I HAD A LONGER STRING AND THEY HAD A SHO- LOT LOT SHORTER STRING
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING PENDULUMS AND TODAY WE DID HOW DOES THE LENGTH OF STRING MAKE IT DIFFERENT
IT'S SHOWING THE LENGTH OF THE STRING AND HOW MANY IT DID LIKE THE SHORTEST STRING DID TWENTY SWINGS
THE EIGHTEEN CENTIMETER ONE WOULD PROBABLY BE A LOT SHORTER OR MAKE MORE SWINGS AND THE THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETER PENDULUM WOULD PROBABLY BE UM MEDIUM ON IT AND THEN THE ONE HUNDREDS CENTIMETER PENDULUM WOULD PROBABLY BE UM PRETTY LOW CAUSE IT'S THE HIGHEST NUMBER
WE DIDN'T MAKE A GRAPH
THE FIFTEEN CENTIMETER ONE DID TWENTY SWINGS
THE LONGER THE STRING THE LESS SWINGS IT MAKES LIKE WE I DID A HUNDRED AND TWENTY CENTIMETERS AND IT ONLY DID SEVEN SWINGS AND MY FRIEND TAYLOR HE DID ONE HUNDRED AND I MEAN NO HE DID FIFTEEN SWINGS <SNIFF> AND HE GOT TWENTY F TWENTY ONE SWINGS
AND THE TWO HUNDRED DID FIVE SWINGS AND THEN ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY DID SIX SWINGS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN TWO HUNDRED ONE HUN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY CENTIMETERS DID SEVEN SWINGS NINETY CENTIMETERS DID EIGHT SWINGS SEVENTY CENTIMETERS DID NINE SWINGS FIFTY FIVE CENTIMETERS DID FIVE SWINGS FORTY FIVE CENTIMETERS DID ELEVEN SWINGS
GOOD
TH HOW MANY SWINGS OR HOW MANY THINGS ARE IN A BOTTLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO LIKE GUESS HOW MANY ARE IN OR HOW MANY IT'LL DO
IT HAS TO TRAVEL A LONGER DISTANCE TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE AND BACK <BREATH>
UH WE FOUND OUT THAT THE LONGER THE STRING MAKES IT SLOWER AND THE SHORTER THE STRING MAKES IT A LOT LONGER
YES
THEY KEEP TIME KIND OF LIKE ON A GRANDFATHER CLOCK THEY KEEP TIME
THE BOB IS THE THING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PENDULUM AND WE FOUND OUT THE LIGHTER IT IS THE FASTER IT WOULD SWING CAUSE THEN THERE'S NOT AS MUCH GRAVITY PULLING IT DOWN
WE TIED A STRING TO A PAPERCLIP AND THEN PUT A PENNY INSIDE THE PAPERCLIP AND THEN AFTER THAT WE TIED WELL WE TAPED THE END OF THE STRING TO THE TO THE UH AMOUNT OF CENTIMETERS AND THEN MADE A LITTLE LOOP TAPED IT AND THEN ATTACHED IT TO A PENCIL
YOU ARE ONLY CHANGING ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME YOU'RE CHANGING THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM NOT THE LENGTH AND THE WEIGHT OF THE BOB THAT WOULD BE A BAD EXPERIMENT
I'VE BEEN STUDYING PENDULUMS
GOOD
THE SHORTER EIGHTEEN CENTIMETER ONE WOULD SWING A LOT FASTER AND THEN PROBABLY THE THIRTY EIGHT CENTIMETER ONE WOULD PROBABLY JUST BE PRETTY NORMAL AND THEN THE ONE HUNDRED CENTIMETER PENDULUM WOULD PROBABLY GO THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIMES
PREDICT I PREDICT THAT THE HIGHER IT GOES OR THE LIGHTER IT IS THE HIGHER AND FARTHER IT GOES
GOOD
<BREATH> THE FLIPPER BASE HOLDS THE STICK AND THE THE STICK YOU WOULD PUSH DOWN AND YOU'D HAVE THE CORK ON IT AND THEN WHEN YOU LET GO IT SHOOTS THE CORK
N OF THE FOUR
WELL
RIGHT NOW IT'S SHOWING HOW HIGH IT GOES AND YOU CAN ALSO YOU CAN DO A HEAVIER OR LIGHTER OBJECT
UM WHAT I THINK IS THE HIGHER THE ANGLE THE FARTHER IT WILL SHOOT
WE HAVE BEEN TESTING VARIABLES ON LITTLE PLANES THAT WE'VE MADE
MAYBE THE HEAVIER GOES HIGHER OR NO THE HEAVIER GOES LOWER CAUSE IT WEIGHS A LOT MORE
<BREATH> I THOUGHT THAT THE BIGGER THE ANGLE THAT YOU HAVE IT AT THE THE FARTHER IT WOULD GO
THANK YOU
UM JUST A LITTLE BIT
HOW HIGH IT GOES
WHAT THEY ARE IS THEY'RE KINDA LIKE CATAPULTS YOU PUSH DOWN ON
HOW MUCH THE UM
THANK YOU
BYE
THANK YOU
PROBABLY THE FARTHER YOU PUT IT IN LIKE CLOSER TO THE ONE CENTIMETERS THAT ARE OUT IF HE HAD ONE CENTIMETER OUT IT'D PROBABLY GO HIGHER UP OR IT'D PROBABLY GO THE FARTHEST
YOU CAN SHOOT A A CORK YOU CAN SHOOT A BALL YOU CAN SHOOT UM
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE SHOOTING IT FROM THE YOU'RE SHOOTING THE BALL TIN FOIL FORTY CENTIMETERS FROM THE FLIPPER
OR YOU COULD PUT ONE AT A TIME YOU'D PUT THE STICK INTO THE FLIPPER BASE AND YOU'D HAVE THE FLIPPER BASE ON THE ANGLE BRACE THEN YOU COULD PUT THE RUBBER STOPPER IN OR YOU CAN PUT THE CORK IN
RIGHT
IT SEEMS LIKE IT GOES A LOT HIGHER THAN IT GOES FARTHER
NO NOT YET BUT I THINK I KNOW IT WILL HAPPEN
IT'S OKAY
MAKE YOU ABLE TO SHOOT
THE DIFF AT A DIFFERENT ANGLE
THE THE S STICK IS PUSHED IN ABOUT HALF THE WAY SO THEN IT SHOOTS PRETTY HARD
WELL WHAT I'M SEEING IS THAT THE CLOSER YOU HAVE IT IN THE HIGHER IT GOES SO ABOUT AT ONE CENTIMETER IT GOES THE HIGHEST AND THEN IT GOES TO TWO CENTIMETERS WHICH GOES A LITTLE BIT LOWER
<BREATH> YOU HAVE THE CORKS WHICH WILL PROBABLY BE SHOT OUT OF THE CATAPULT YOU HAVE THE FLIPPER BASE WHERE YOU PUT THE STICK IN AND YOU HAVE THE STICK THAT WILL SH SHOOT THE CORKS AND THEN YOU HAVE THE ANGLER WHICH YOU WOULD PUT IT IN
THEN IT WOULDN'T GO AS FAR IF IT WAS A LOT HEAVIER BUT IF IT WASN'T THAT HEAVY IT WOULD PROBABLY GO THE FARTHEST THE LIGHTER THE LIGHTEST WOULD GO THE FARTHEST
WELL THOSE ARE VARIABLES IF LIKE WELL MOSTLY THE OBJECT IS A VARIABLE BECAUSE LIKE IF IT'S HEAVIER IF IT'S A LOT LOT HEAVIER THEN IT WOULD
WELL THE LENGTHS OF THE STICKS ARE EACH A CENTIMETER APART
IT IS A GRAPH WITH AN X AND Y AXIS
THE Y AXIS IS ALWAYS LIKE THE TOP ONE AND THAT'S WHERE YOU PUT THE DISTANCE
WELL PROBABLY THE MORE PASSENGERS YOU HAVE THE LESS UM
NO YOU PUT THE UM DISTANCE ON THE X AXIS AND YOU PUT THE PASSENGERS ON THE Y AXIS
IT SEEMS LIKE THE MORE MOTORS THAT YOU HAD THE FARTHER IT WENT LIKE ON FIVE MOTORS IT WENT ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE FEET OR INCHES OR CENTIMETERS SO IT WENT PRETTY FAR WITH THE BIGGER AND OR MORE MOTORS
OKAY BYE
WE DIDN'T REALLY LEARN THAT THIS TIME THAT WE DID SCIENCE
THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE GET YOU'VE GATHERED UM IN THE EXPERIMENT THAT YOU JUST DID
HI
WE HAD MADE THEM OUT OF STRAWS UM POPSICLE STICKS AND PROPELLERS AND THE PROPELLERS WOULD BE ATTACHED TO A RUBBERBAND AND THEY WOULD SPIN TO POWER THE PLANE
IT IS ALWAYS ON THE BOTTOM AND IT'S LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS OR THE MOTOR
YOU WOULD PUT LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS ON THE Y AXIS AND THEN DISTANCE WOULD GO ON THE X AXIS
THEY BOTH COUNT BY ONES AND GO ALL THE WAY UP TO TEN
WELL UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW
YOU KEPT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS <COUGH>
THEY WOULD GO ON THE Y AXIS
UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT HOW TO EXPLAIN THAT QUESTION
WHAT I THINK THIS IS ABOUT IS YOU WOULD PUT LIKE FIVE AND LIKE FOR AN EXAMPLE IF YOU HAD ONE PASSENGER AND IT WENT NINE FEET OR EIGHT FEET YOU WOULD DRAW A DOT RIGHT THERE
R IS THE SAME SO THAT IS GOOD AND ALSO BUT ALL YOU DID IS CHANGE THE WINDS SO PROBABLY FIFTY WINDS WOULD GO PROBABLY THE FARTHEST
I SEE A LITTLE CANDLE THAT IS ON FIRE <SIDE_SPEECH>  AND IT'S MELTING FROM THE OR FROM THE HEAT
HEAT ENERGY
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW LIGHT BULBS COULD LIGHT UP AND +UM+ PARALLEL CIRCUIT
IT DOES I'M LIKE ANYTHING IT'S JUST WHAT +SHH+
COULD YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ENERGY AND THE WIRE +UM+ IT RELATES TO HEAT ENERGY AND IT YEAH
BECAUSE THEN YOU WON'T LIKE GET TO LIKE HAVE THE ENERGY AND CHARGING ELECTRONICS AND HOW LONG
I'M DOING GOOD REALLY GOOD
I GET SEE THAT HEAT ENERGY IS BURNING THE WAX SO THE WAX MELTS AND THAT CALLED BE A
NO
LIGHT ENERGY
I DON’T KNOW YEAH
THE LIGHT BULB
SO THAT BACK THE D CALL IS FLOWING FROMM THE (*)
THE COMPONENTS HAVE TO BE CALLED +AH UMM+ ONE WIRE HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND THEN OTHER WIRE HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE WIRE AND IF THE POSITIVE WIRE HAS TO BE TO THE BOTTOM OF IT <BREATH> AND THEN THE NEGATIVE SIDE POSSIBLY ON THE SIDE OF THE BATTERY
WIRES THEY GET THE ELECTRICITY SO THE LIGHT BULB
THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE +UM+ <BREATH> MOTOR THE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE SIDE IT WON'T TO THE WIRES CONNECTED TO THE BULB
THE BATTERY IS RECEIVED NO THE LIGHT BULB IS RECEIVING THE ENERGY FROM THE
THE WIRES CARRY +HUM+ ELECTRICITY SHOW THE BATTERIES THE LIGHT BULB COULD LIGHT UP
<BREATH> OKAY
ITS FLOWING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE TO THAT
THE D-CELL BATTERY +AH UMM+ IS OMITTED IS PUT IN THE ELECTRICITY INTO THE POSITIVE THE NEGATIVE SIDE <SIDE_SPEECH> AND IF IT'S FLOWING TO THE TO THE BATTERY AND THEN IT'S FLOWING OUT OF THE BATTERY <COUGH> TO THE POSITIVE SIDE SO THAT IT JUST KEEPS ON ROTATING SO IT CAN
THAT THE D CELL MAKE <SIED_SPEECH> +HUM+
SO YOU WHY
<NO VOICE>
IT WILL SHUT OFF AND AND THE LIGHT WILL +HUM+ TURN
SO IF YOU FLIP IT IT GOES THE DIRECTION OF THE OTHER WAY
WHAT
THEY MAKE THE WIRE HMM (*)
THE WIRE A BATTERY  SPEAKER 2:  THE LIGHT
IT PUT LIGHT UP ANYMORE
A LIGHT BULB IS RECEIVED BY +HMM+ BECAUSE +AH UMM+ IT RECEIVES LIKE EITHER MONEY OR ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY SHORT COULD LIGHT UP
I'M DOING GOOD
A FLIPPED OVER SO
WHICH IS WHAT MEANT TO BE
IT PROVIDES +AH UMM+ HAVE THE
IT MEANS THAT +AH UMM+ THE WIRES CARRY THE +AH+ ELECTRICITY TO THE +HMM+ TO THE +AH+ TO THE LIGHT BULB TO LIGHT UP
YOU HAVE TO PUT ONE ON THE BOTTOM AND THEN ON THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB SO THE D CELL SO YOU HAVE TO PUT THE NEGATIVE AND POSTIVE SIDE AND THEN YOU PUT MIDDLE PIECE TO THE BOTTOM AND THEN THE SIDE AND THEN TO MAKE IT LIGHTER
<SIDE_SPEECH> WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN
TO CARRY THE ELECTRICITY TO THE WIRE TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTER
I’VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SPEAKER 2:  HE HAVE +HUM+ CIRCUIT MOVES AND MOTOR'S WORK AND HAVE TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULB
THE WIRE IS LIKE THEY MAKE ALL THE ELECTRICITY ONE FROM ANOTHER (*)
THE ELECTRICITY THAT FLOWS TO LIGHT UP THE LIGHT BULB
<BREATH> THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE BACK
THE SET UP IS <SIDE_SPEECH> <BREATH>
THE BLUE DOTS REPRESENT +AH UMM+ THE ELECTRICITY
THE POINT THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
THEY ARE CALLED WIRES
BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT FLOWING TO THE BULB RIGHT
LIGHT BULBS IS ABOUT HOW YOU COULD +AH UM+M WOULD IT LIGHT UPTO ROOM AND HAS GAS IN IT'S SO YOU COULD  LIGHT UP FROM THE ENERGY
WIRE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT
+UM+ IT MAKES IT A CIRCUIT THAT
WE'VE BEEN DOING <SIDE_SPEECH> +UM+ WE'VE BEEN DOING <SILENCE>WE'VE BEEN DOING THEN THAT HOW THE MAGNETS CAN PRODUCE ENERGY TO AND ALSO AND ALSO LIKE
IF YOU HAVE A POSITIVE SIDE AND A NEGATIVE SIDE CONNECTED TOGETHER
ONE IS- ONE IS THAT YOU- ONE IS DIM WITH +UM+ WITH ONE BATTERY AND THE TWO BATTERIES IS THE BATTERY THE LIGHT BULBS ARE VERY BRIGHT
OH WE'VE BEEN DOING +UM+ HAVE <SIDE_SPEECH>
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
THE BULBS ARE GETTING DIMMER
<SIDE_SPEECH> CAN YOU REPEAT PLEASE
IT'S FLOWING TO THE BATTERY THE TWO LIGHT BULBS AND THE PATHWAY IT'S FLOWING TO THE TWO LIGHT BULBS THE BATTERY THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE WIRES THE BLUE DOTS ARE ELECTRICITY JUST FOR YOUR INFORMATION
A CIRCUIT IS
THERE IS THREE FILAMENTS
I'M ACTUALLY DOING PRETTY GOOD
+UM+ WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT NEGATIVE SIDE AND- ON NEGATIVE SIDE- THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE WILL NOT FLOW BUT WHEN YOU'RE CLICKING ON IT AGAIN THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE WILL FLOW
<SIDE_SPEECH> I DON'T
+UM+ WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT NEGATIVE SIDE AND A NEGATIVE SIDE THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE WILL NOT FLOW BUT WHEN YOU CLICK ON HERE AGAIN THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE WILL FLOW
<BREATH> IT'S A COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND THE THE PATHWAY IS THE WIRES THE PATHWAYS GOING TO THE <SIDE_SPEECH>  THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT BULB AND THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT GET'S BRIGHTER
ONE BATTERY ONE
<SIDE_SPEECH> OKAY
<BREATH> CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
I DON'T KNOW
WHEN YOU LIKE DON'T PUT- WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE NEGATIVE SIDE CONNECTING TO THE POSITIVE SIDE THAT WILL NOT MAKE IT FLOW
<SIDE_SPEECH> I DON'T KNOW
THE BLUE DOT ARE ELECTRICITY
I DON'T KNOW
+AH+ I DON'T KNOW
IT GOT BRIGHTER
BYE HAVE A GOOD DAY
<SIDE_SPEECH> IT FLOWS THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE BATTERY TO THE TO THE (*) TO THE BATTERY TO THE BATTERY AND THEN THE NEXT WIRE YOU <BREATH>
THE ONE D-CELL IS BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER AND WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY A LIGHT BULB IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
THE D-CELL
<BREATH> CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
OKAY
+UM+ IT LIKE IT LIKES THE SUN LIKE IT'S LIKE BRINGING ELECTRICITY SO THE +HM+ THE MOTOR COULD MOVE
THE ELECTRICITY IS BRINGING BACK TO THE MOTOR AND THE ON D-CELL
THE ELECTRIC THAT FLOWS POLE IS MODED IT TO POLE IS MODED THE ENERGY TO NOTHING
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
THE CIRCUIT
IT DOESN'T LEAVE OR IT DOESN'T MAKE THE ELECTRICITY ON FLOW TO THE MOTOR AM I CORRECT
<NO_SIGNAL>
I DON'T KNOW OH YEAH
BAD
THE BATTERY DOES THAT BRING THE BATTERY BRINGS THE ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR FROM THE ONE
I NOTICED THAT +UM+ THE SWITCH IS CLOSE THAT THE MOTOR KEEPS ON IT SPINS AND
A WIRE IS TOOK THAT THEY TO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE MOTOR
<SIDE_SPEECH> I DON'T
CAN YOU REPEAT IT
THE D-CELL IS CONNECTED TO THE WIRES WHICH IS TRAVEL THE WIRE IS TRAVELLING TO THE MOTOR TO MAKE THE MOTOR FLAGS SPIN
WHAT BRING ELECTRICITY INTO THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR COULD SPIN
IT STOPS MOVING
NO
IT'S CLOSE OPEN
THE SOLAR PANEL IS COLLECTING SUN LIGHT WHICH IS ENERGY TO BRING TO THE WIRES TO THE MOTORS SO THE MOTOR CAN RUN
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
IT'S CLOSED BECAUSE +UM+ THE ELECTRICITY IS NOT GOING TO THE MOTOR A BUT ONE I CLOSED IT WILL
I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE A GO GONE OUTSIDE AND USED IT YET
SO LIKE ARE YOU ASKING LIKE SO LIKE +UM+ ONE IT'S LIKE SO YOU ARE YOU ASKING LIKE ONE IT'S CLOSED IT'S IS RUNNING AGAIN
THE MOTOR TURNS BY THE D-CELL
THE SWITCH IN THE PICTURE IS SO LIKE IT BURNT ON IT
THE MOTOR STARTS SPINNING AGAIN
THE WIRE
IT'S +UM+ THE MOTOR SPINS THAT
I DON'T KNOW
WELL WE'VE BEEN WATCHING HOW TO +UM+ TO THE MOTOR AND THE CIRCUITS WITH THE BACK DETAIL D-CELL
THE PICTURES SHOWING THAT THOUGH IT'S LIKE A DIFFERENT SETUP THAT WE DID WITH THE BACK +UM+ WITH THE LIGHT BULB AND SO WHAT WE'RE USING LIKE +SSS+ YEAH
CONDUCTORS ARE +UM+ OTHER PARTS THAT WOULD MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
I CAN TOLD YOU THAT THE INSULATORS OR OBJECTS THAT MAKE THE MOTOR RUN OR NOT WORK
OKAY BYE MORNIE WHAT IS THAT YOUR NAME?
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO COMPLETE CIRCUITS AND HOW TO COMPLETE MOTOR COMPLETE CIRCUIT
I DON'T KNOW
CONDUCTORS ARE +UM+ A PART THAT COULD ACTUALLY MAKE THE MOTORS RUN OR NOT RUN OKAY YOU GET IN THAT MORNIE
I NOTICED THAT IT'S NOT SPINNING BECAUSE IT'S NOT TOUCHING THE METAL PART
+UM+
I NOTICED THAT THE I NOTICED THAT SOME OBJECTS ARE MAKING THE MOTOR SPIN
YEAH
<NO_SIGNAL>
I DOING GOOD
+ER+ I DON'T KNOW
I FOUND OUT THAT +UM+ ALL THE METAL PARTS AND WOOD AND ALL THE PLASTIC PARTS AND THE WOOD AND THE SPONZE
+UH HMM+
ONE +UM+ THE ONE WHEN ALL THE OBJECTS WOULD NOT <BREATH> WHAT WOULD TOUCHING THE SOME OBJECTS WERE LIKE MAKING THE MOTORS SPIN SO YEAH OKAY SO NOW ARE YOU THERE SAY
A CONDUCTOR +UM+ LIKE PRODUCES SO LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO TOUCH THE WIRES TO THE TO THE MOTOR SO IT JUST GIVES YOU BETTER RESOURCES (*)  SO YOU GET AT THIS MORNIE OKAY
<BREATH> THE +UM+ ALL THE METAL PLATES ARE GOING TO WORK AND ALL THE PLATE THAT ARE NOT METAL WERE NOT WORK
I DON'T KNOW
+UM+ YOU JUST BE I DON'T LIKE
WHO GOING TO ASK ME ABOUT HOW I'M FEELING
THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITVE SIDE
WIRES D-CELL AND LIGHT BULB
<BREATH> I'M DOING BAD TODAY
I DON'T KNOW I'M SORRY
THE SALT DISSOLVES IN THE WATER
NO
YOU ARE MIXING THE SALT WITH THE WATER AND IT DISSOLVES
THE SALT DISSOLVED
WE CALL THEM A SOLUTE
A SOLUTION
THE MASS HAS BECOME GREATER
A SOLUTION
IT IS CONSIDERED A MIXTURE
THE SAND STAYS IN THE CUP AND THE SALT DISSOLVES
THAT MEANS WHEN THE SOLUTE IS MIXED WITH THE WATER IT IS STILL THERE SO IT STILL HAS WEIGHT
IT IS A
A SOLUTION
WELL THE WATER GOES AWAY AND THE SALT IS SHOWN AGAIN AND IT TURNS INTO A A SALT CRYSTAL
CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT MA'AM
WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THE MASS IS EACH OF THE DIFFERENT PILES WEIGH SOMETHING AND YOU JUST ADD THEM AND THAT'S THE WEIGHT OF THE BIG PILE MIXED
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
THE MASS IS GETTING BIGGER
THE ROLE THE WATER IS PLAYING IN THIS PICTURE IS WHAT DOES NOT DISSOLVE
YOU USE A SCREEN
YES
NO
IT MEANS WHEN YOU MIX THINGS IT MAKES THE WEIGHT MORE
A MIXTURE
CAN YOU PLEASE SHOW THE ANIMATION AGAIN MA'AM
WHEN THE SALT IS ADDED TO THE CUP ON THE RIGHT IT MAKES IT WAY MORE
THAT MEANS IT IS A SOLUTION
YOU ARE MIXING THESE TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER
THE MASS BECOMES GREATER BECAUSE YOU ADD THE WATER PLUS THE SALT
THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE IN THE WATER
COULD YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT
ON THE RIGHT THEY ARE ALL MIXED
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
EXCUSE ME MA'AM BUT WHY DO YOU KEEP REPEATING THE ANIMATION
WHAT THE SOLUTE ROLES PLAYS IN THE SOLUTION IS IT'S THE ONE THAT DISSOLVES
<SILENCE>
THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED
ON THE SCREEN IT IS SHOWING TRYING TO SEPARATE THE TWO MIXTURES
WHAT HAPPENED IS IT WENT BACK TOGETHER AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T STAY
THE TRAIL MIX IS GETTING SEPARATED
THE TRAIL MIX SEPARATE INTO DIFFERENT
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS IT'S GETTING INTO GROUPS AND IT'S IMPORTANT CAUSE IT'S NOT A MIXTURE ANYMORE
A SOLUTION
THE WATER AND THE MARBLES ARE GETTING SEPARATED
IN THE PICTURE IT SHOWS THINGS THAT ARE MIXED TOGETHER
THE PILE ON THE LEFT IS MIXED AND THE PILE ON THE RIGHT ARE SEPARATED
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS
THEY ARE GETTING INTO SEPARATE GROUPS
YOU CAN MIX THEM TOGETHER
IT'S FILTERING OUT THE MARBLES
YOU CALL IT A MIX
THEY CHANGED BECAUSE THEY GOT SEPARATED
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
I CAN IDENTIFY SALAD BEANS AND PAPER CLIPS AND THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER
GREEN RED PURPLE BLUE
I BELIEVE NUMBER ON IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED
THE CUP ON THE RIGHT IS TWENTY GRAMS AND THE CUP ON THE LEFT IF TEN GRAMS SORRY I JUST HAVE TO
I THINK THE SOLUTION THAT IS MOST LEAST CONCENTRATED IS NUMBER TWO
THE FIRST IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND THE SECOND IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
YES
THE ROCK WEIGHS NINETY GRAMS AND THE FEATHER WEIGHS TWO GRAMS SO THE ROCK WEIGHS MORE
THEY ARE DIFFERENT
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS AND HOW THEY ARE SEPARATED
I'M HORRIBLE TODAY THANKS FOR ASKING
I'M SORRY MARNEY I DON'T KNOW
BECAUSE YOU PUT MORE GRAMS IN THE RIGHT CUP
I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW
THEY ARE BOTH THE SOLUTE
BY THE SHADE OF THE GLASS
I DID WELL IN MY PREDICTION MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT
THE GRAPE DRINK IS THE MIX AND THE SALT WATER IS A SOLUTION
WHAT I THINK WILL HAPPEN IS THE CUP ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE WHEN YOU PUT IT IN SO IT WILL GO TOWARDS THAT WAY
CUP OF SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE RIGHT IS TWENTY GRAMS AND THE CUP OF SALT WATER SOLUTION ON THE LEFT IS TEN GRAMS
YOU ARE WEIGHING THE CHEMICALS THING
IT'S AN ADDITION PROBLEM
YOU IDENTIFIED THE CRYSTALS
YOU'RE MIXING THE WATER WITH THE SUBSTANCE
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
ONE OF THE MASSES WEIGHS MORE
BECAUSE ONE BAG IS OPEN AND THE OTHER ISN'T I KNEW THAT QUESTION OH IT'S STILL ON
WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT GASES
THERE WAS A CHEMICAL REACTION SO IT BUBBLED
THEY ARE MAKING A CHEMICAL REACTION
I'M I DON'T KNOW I'M SORRY
THE BAG CLOSED WEIGHS MORE
I SEE A WATER REACTANT A BAKING SODA REACTANT AND A CALCIUM CHLORIDE REACTANT I GOTTA MOVE FROM HERE MY BUTTS TOO COLD
I SEE A REACTANT
A GAS WAS CREATE
I SEE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHAT MAKES IT HAPPEN IS A MIXTURE OF TWO DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES
YOU MIXED TWO SUBSTANCES TOGETHER TO MAKE A CHEMICAL REACTION
WHAT I NOTICED IS THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLILITER WATER ON THE RIGHT HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
ONE WILL BE HEAVIER
NUMBER ONE IS MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER TWO IS LEAST CONCENTRATED
THE DIFFERENCE I SEE IS THE SOLUTE
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SOLUTIONS
BECAUSE ONE CUP HAS TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND ANOTHER CUP HAS TEN GRAMS OF SOLUTE
HOW YOU CAN DETERMINE IS BY TASTING THEM
WHAT IS HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING IN SCIENCE IS THE GRAPE DRINK MIX THE LIGHTER ONE IS THE ONE WITH MORE WATER AND THE SALT WATER SOLUTION WELL THEY'RE EQUAL
SOLUTION ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND SOLUTION TWO IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
SOLUTION B
YOU CAN TASTE THEM
THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER
THE CONCENTRATION IS DIFFERENT
WE ARE SEEING WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER
NUMBER ONE IS THE MOST CONCENTRATED AND NUMBER THREE IS THE LEAST CONCENTRATED
BYE
MY PREDICTION WAS CORRECT WHAT I NOTICED WAS THE TWENTY GRAMS OF SOLUTE AND THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLIMETERS OF WATER WERE MORE
GOOD
YES
SO WITH A ZERO SPACERS IT IS 19 IT TAKES 19 WASHERS TO BREAK IT WITH ZERO SPACERS WITH ONE SPACERS IT TAKES NINE WASHERS TO BREAK THE MAGNETIC FORCE WITH TWO SPACERS WILL TAKE SIX WASHERS TO BREAK THE MAGNETIC FORCE WITH THREE SPACERS IT TAKES THREE AND FOUR SPACERS IT TAKES FIVE IF OF THOSE WASHERS TO BREAK THE MAGNETIC FORCE AND SIX AND FIVE SPACERS THREE IT TAKES THREE TO BREAK THE FORCE
IT MAKES IT TAKES LESS WASHERS TO BREAK THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM
THERE ARE ZERO SPACERS AND ZERO WASHERS IF YOU ADD SPACERS IT MAKES THAT THE MAGNETIC FIELD FURTHER AWAY FROM
THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE PAPERCLIP THROUGH THE THIN STACK
WHEN THERE IS TOO MUCH OF WEIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BALANCE SCALE THE MAGNETIC FORCE IT’S TOO WEAK TO PULL THE MAGNETS TOGETHER
IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAK
SO WASHERS ARE BEING THROWN INTO A CUP WHICH IS BREAKING THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION WITH WEIGHT
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ATTRACTION FORCE BECAUSE IT IS TOO THICK
WELL TO INCREASE THE DISTANCE YOU ADD SPACERS
WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS THEN IT WEAKENS THE MAGNETIC FIELD
WELL WHEN YOU TRY TO SEPARATE THE MAGNETS IF THERE IS TOO MUCH WEIGHT THEN THE MAGNETIC FORCE DOESN’T WORK
WE’VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION BREAKING WITH A WAY
WHEN YOU ADD SPACERS IT INTERACTS WITH THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAKING IT WEAKER BECAUSE ITS FARTHER AWAY
WELL THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAKES THE MAGNETS ATTRACT BUT THE SPACERS KEEP THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM ATTRACTING
THE FORCE OF MAGNETISM IS VERY STRONG BUT AS YOU PUT IN MORE OF THOSE SPACERS IT WEAKENS THE FORCE BECAUSE OF DISTANCE
WELL WHEN YOU DROP IN WASHERS THEN IT IS WEIGHING DOWN THE MAGNETIC FORCE WHICH IS MAKING IT WEAKER BECAUSE THE WEIGHT IS STRONGER THAN THE MAGNETIC FORCE IT MAKES THE MAGNETS REPEL EACH OTHER
GOOD
WELL IF THE SPACERS IN THERE IS MAKING THE MAGNETIC FORCE STRONGER SO THE STRONG MAGNETIC FIELD IS WEAKER BECAUSE THE SPACER ARE SEPARATING THEM
I’VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS
THE BULB WILL GET BRIGHTER
THERE IS ONE D-CELL AND TWO BULBS
SERIES
BECAUSE THERE IS LESS ENERGY
THE TOP CIRCUITS ARE SHINING BRIGHTER BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ENERGY
GOOD
EACH BULB HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY
THE ENERGY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
SO THE PATHWAY OF ELECTRICITY BOTH COME OUT OF THE BATTERY THROUGH IN SEPARATE PATHS TO THE LIGHTBULBS AND BACK INTO THE BATTERY
WELL IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT SO ONE WIRE GOES ONE SET OF WIRE GOES TO ONE OF THE LIGHTBULBS AND THE OTHER SET OF WIRES GOES TO THE OTHER LIGHTBULB
IT ONLY HAS ONE BULB
EACH BULB HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY
IT WOULD MAKE THE BULB BRIGHTER BECAUSE THEN THERE WOULD BE MORE ENERGY TO FLOW IN
PARALLEL
WELL BOTH OF THE- THE PARALLEL IN A SIMPLE CIRCUIT BOTH HAVE MORE ENERGY FOR THE BULBS WHILE THE SERIES CIRCUIT DEPTH LESS BECAUSE IT FLOWS THROUGH BOTH BULBS IN ONE CIRCUIT INSTEAD OF SPLIT INTO HALF
THIS IS NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT’S A SERIES CIRCUIT BECAUSE EACH BULB IS CONNECTED IN THE SAME CIRCUIT
THE SERIES CIRCUIT HAS LESS OF AN ENERGY FLOW BECAUSE BECAUSE BOTH LIGHT BULBS ARE CONNECTED IN ONE PATHWAY IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT HAS MORE ENERGY BECAUSE THEY ARE CONNECTED IN TWO PATHWAYS
WELL THE ENERGY FLOW OUT TWO WAYS IN THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND THEN FLOWS IN TWO WAYS INTO THE POSITIVE
YES THERE ARE TWO
THERE ARE TWO POWER SOURCES
BECAUSE THERE’S TWO PATHWAYS IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THERE IS ONE IN A SERIES CIRCUIT AND THERE IS STILL ONE IN A SIMPLE CIRCUIT EXCEPT THERE IS LESS COMPONENTS
TWO
SERIES AND PARALLEL
WELL THE ENERGY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE THROUGH THE FIRST LIGHTBULB BULB BASE AND THEN INTO THE SECOND LIGHTBULB’S BULB BASE BACK THROUGH FROM THE CASING TO THE OTHER BULB’S CASING IT BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF A TERMINAL THERE IS ONE PATHWAY SO IT’S A SERIES CIRCUIT
THE BAN- THEN THE ENERGY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY
IT WILL POLLUTE THE AIR AND MOST OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND RELEASE SMOG
BURNING FLAMES AND YOU ALSO SEE WAX MELTING
POLLUTION
SOUNDS LIKE SOME THINGS IS SIZZLE
THE ENVIRONMENT WILL NOT BE POLLUTED
WELL THE PERSON'S BURNING CALORIES WALKING UP A MOUNTAIN
WOOD GAS FOOD AND A CANDLE
THE ENERGY FORCE MAKES A BOOM OR SOME KIND OF NOISE THAT SHOWS ENERGY IS PRESENT
IT WILL BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FROM
GOOD
IT WILL BE ALL POLLUTED SO THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD USE LIKE SOLAR ENERGY AND WIND ENERGY AND EVEN WATER
IT RELEASES POLLUTION INTO THE AIR
A CANDLE BURNING HEAT
THEY POLLUTING THE EARTH WHILE SOLAR PANELS DO NOT POLLUTE THE EARTH
ENERGY IS POWER THAT WE USE TO PUT THINGS IN TO MOTION OR LIGHT OR SOUND
EATING FOOD
LIGHT AND HEAT
A HEAT IS EMITTING FROM THE WICK QUICK AND IT'S ALSO GIVING OFF LIGHT
WELL THE GAS IS POLLUTING AND FOOD WIND WATER AND SOLAR ENERGY DO NOT LIKE THEY DON’T RELEASE POLLUTION
THEY’RE BOTH RENEWABLE AND THEY CAN ALWAYS BE USED WHILE GAS AND COAL ARE NON-RENEWABLE AND MAY RUN OUT SOME DAY
THEY’RE BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND THEY BOTH NEED OUTDOOR THING
A PERSON IS BEATING THE DRUM IS MAKING SOUND ENERGY
YES YOU CAN BECAUSE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THAT DRUM TO MAKE IT RELEASE A SOUND
IT IS FLICKERING GIVING OFF HEAT AND MAKING LIGHT
I AM NOT SURE
WE HAVE BEEN DOING SOME EXPERIMENTS WITH LIKE HEAT ICE SORT OF THING AND LIKE CRANK ENERGY
SHE IS MOVING
WELL SO IT SO THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL PRODUCES THE ENERGY AND THE POSITIVE SIDE COLLECTS THE ENERGY
THE LIGHT BULB TURNS ON
I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND ENERGY FLOW THROUGH LIGHT BULBS AND MOTORS
LIGHT BULB RECEIVES THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY
I'M GOOD
WELL IF YOU FLIP IT I THINK IT WILL STILL TRAVEL THROUGH THE BULB AND THE BULB WILL STILL LIGHT
SEE THE ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB FILAMENT WELL SO THE THE ENERGY COMES OUT OF THE D CELL THROUGH THE WIRES IT TOUCHES THE BULB CASING GOES THROUGH THE FILAMENT AND COMES OUT THROUGH THE BULB BASE INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY
IF THE D CELL WEREN'T THERE THE THE BULB WOULD NOT LIGHT UP BECAUSE THERE'S NO ENERGY
THE NEGATIVE
REPRESENT THE ELECTRONS FLOWING THROUGH
WIRES CARRY THE ENERGY TO CERTAIN PARTS
SO THE ENERGY'S COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE
THE LIGHT BULB TAKES THE ENERGY AND MAKES THE FILAMENT IN THERE GET SO HOT THAT IT WILL PRODUCE LIGHT
THE D CELL GIVES POWER INTO THE CIRCUIT
WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO THE D CELL ON THE POSITIVE TERMINAL FROM THE LIGHT BULB
THERE ARE COMPONENTS IN A CIRCUIT THE D CELL A LIGHT BULB AND WIRES
THINK THAT ONE OF THE CONTACT POINTS WOULD NOT GET TOUCHED AND THE LIGHT BULB WOULD TURN OFF
ON THE D CELL I NOTICE THE ELECTRONS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE AND IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE
WIRES CARRY THE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN COMPONENTS OR ENERGY
THE POSITIVE SIDE IS RECEIVING THE ENERGY THAT COMES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE
WELL WHEN YOU FLIP THE D CELL THE ENERGY I THINK STILL FLOWS THE SAME WAY
SO THE PROVIDES THE ENERGY FOR THE FOR THE ELECTRICITY FOR THE COMPONENTS TO CARRY IT THROUGH AND TRANSFER IT
THESE HAVE STORED ENERGY INSIDE THEM AND ARE USED TO POWER A
THE LIGHT BULBS ARE LIKE THE THE EVIDENCE OF THE ENERGY TRANSFER AND GIVE OFF LIGHT
THE SETUP IS THAT A WIRE TOUCHES THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL OF THE D CELL AND THEN THAT SAME WIRE TOUCHES THE BULB CASING OF THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN WITH A POSITIVE TERMINAL ANOTHER WIRE TOUCHES THERE AND THAT SAME WIRE TOUCHES THE BULB BASE
MEANS THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
WELL THE PARTS IN A CIRCUIT PUT PUT THE CIRCUIT TOGETHER SO WITHOUT PARTS THOSE COMPONENTS A THERE'S THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A CIRCUIT A CIRCUIT IS JUST LIKE A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO FLOW
WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK THROUGH THE D CELL POSITIVE
THE COMPONENTS HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO ALL THE THE RIGHT CONTACT POINTS TO GET THE CIRCUIT TO FLOW THE RIGHT WAY
THE D CELL IS THE SOURCE OF ENERGY
WELL WHEN A BULB GOES OUT THE ELECTRICITY FLOW STOPS
NO ENERGY IS FLOWING
BECAUSE THE FILAMENT BURNS OUT AND LIKE OPENS THE CIRCUIT- LIKE AN OPEN SWITCH
STRINGS OF LIGHTS IN SERIES CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS ARE CONNECTED IN ONE PATHWAY SO IF THE FILAMENT IN A BULB BURNS OUT IT’S LIKE IN OPEN SWITCH SO NO ENERGY CAN FLOW THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
WELL WHEN A FILAMENT BREAKS IT WILL LIKE OPENS THE SWITCH BECAUSE OF BROKEN FILAMENTS LIKE AN OPEN SWITCH
IT’S A SIMPLE CIRCUIT AND THERE IS AND THE SWITCH IS OPEN
<NO_SIGNAL>
IT’S PARALLEL CIRCUITS SO WHEN ONE BULB BURNS OUT THEN THE OTHER ONE STILL KEEPS WORKING BECAUSE THERE’S TWO PATHWAYS
IT’S A SERIES IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IT’S NOT IN SERIES SO WHEN ONE BURNS OUT THE REST KEEP WORKING BECAUSE ONE PATHWAY BREAKS AND THE REST OF THE PATHWAYS ARE STILL FLOWING
THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING BECAUSE THE BULB IS BURNT WHICH IS LIKE AN OPEN CIRCUIT
THIS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND ONE BULB IS BURNT OUT SO THE OTHER ONE GOES OFF
WELL
THE OTHER ONE GOES OUT TOO BECAUSE ONE OF THAT THE FILAMENT IS BURNT UP SO IT’S LIKE IN OPEN SWITCH
THEN ALL THE BULBS GO OUT OF THERE IN A SERIES CIRCUIT
THE OTHER BULB BURNS
STRINGS OF LIGHT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CONNECTED IN PARALLEL CIRCUITS SO THAT THEY DON’T WENT SHUT OF ALL THE BULBS WHEN ONE BULB BURNS OUT
FILAMENT BROKE SO SO THE OTHER BULB GOES OFF TOO IF IT’S A SERIES
A FILAMENT BREAKS AND OPENS THE PATHWAY
SERIES CIRCUITS ARE IN THE STRINGS OF LIGHT AND WHEN A BULB BURNS OUT THEN ALL THE LIGHTS GO OUT ON THE STRING
THE ENERGY IS FLOWING BUT ONE BULB IS BURNT OUT SO GUESS WHAT HAPPENS THE REST OTHER BULBS ARE OFF TOO UNTIL YOU REPLACE THAT THE BURNT BULB
IT’S EASY TO FIND THE ONE THAT’S BURNT OUT SO YOU CAN EASILY REPLACE IT
THE OTHER BULB GETS BRIGHTER BECAUSE THE ENERGY HAS DOESN’T HAVE TO SHARE AND IT STAYS ON
<NO_SIGNAL>
ONE FILAMENT IS BURNT OUT SO THE OTHER BULB IS OFF TOO
A SERIES CIRCUIT MIGHT BE LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT’S GOT ONE PATHWAY THAT LEADS THROUGH ALL THE COMPONENTS
THE THE FILAMENT IS NOT CONNECTED FOR ENERGY TO FLOW
ALL THE COMPONENTS ARE CONNECTED IN ONE PATHWAY
THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED IN PATHWAYS
<NO_SIGNAL>
THE LIGHT TURNS ON BECAUSE OF THE
THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT WITH ENERGY FLOWING INTO THE FILAMENT BURNS OUT SO BECAUSE THE FILAMENT BURNS OUT THEN THE OTHER BULB TURNS OFF
WE’VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WHEN TWO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TWO MAGNETS INTERACT
GOOD
SOMEONE USING A COMPASS TO FIND IN WHAT DIRECTION THEY ARE GOING
THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THE POLES ARE THE SAME
WELL THEY HAVE OPPOSITE POLES AND THOSE OPPOSITE POLES ARE JUST THINK THEY LIKE EACH OTHER THEY WANT TO ATTRACT
IT’S A COMPASS SHOWING YOU NORTH ON THE EARTH
BOTH POLES ARE THE SAME BOTH POLES THEY ARE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER ARE THE SAME
WELL THE NORTH AND SOUTH POLE MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTING THE SOUTH AND SOUTH AND NORTH AND NORTH POLES ON THE MAGNETS ARE REPELLING
THE MAGNETS ARE FLOATING BECAUSE THERE THEY DON’T WANT TO BE CLOSE TO THE OTHER MAGNETS SO THEY ARE REPELLING
THE MAGNET NORTH AND SOUTH POLES ATTRACTING
THEY WILL REPEL EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT WILL BE NORTH POLE AGAINST NORTH POLE OR SOUTH POLE AGAINST SOUTH POLE
WHEN THE OPPOSITE POLES IS CLOSE TO EACH OTHER THEY WILL ATTRACT BUT WHEN THE SAME POLES ARE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER THEY WILL REPEL
IT POSE THE MAGNETIC FLOW OF THE MELTING METAL THAT IS DEEP INSIDE THE EARTH
MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO METAL THINGS WITH IRON OR ANYTHING IT HAS IRON IN IT
WE’VE BEEN TOLD MAGNETS STICK TO ONLY THINGS THAT ARE IRON OR STEEL
SO THE ONLY MATERIALS THAT DID NOT STICK WERE THE RIVER ROCK THE BRASS RING AND THE ALUMINIUM NAIL BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO TRACES OF IRON IN THEM
IT WILL NOT STICK BECAUSE IT IS NOT MAGNETIC
IT’S MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL WHICH STICKS TO THE MAGNET
GOOD
IT’S STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS IT’S MADE OUT OF STEEL WHICH HAS IRON IN IT
MAGNET STICK TO STEEL AND IRON BECAUSE THEY BECAUSE MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON STEEL IS IRON WITH CARBON AND ALUMINIUM HAS NO IRON
MAGNETS ONLY STICK TO IRON BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OUT OF IRON AND IRON IS MAGNETIC STEEL HAS TRACES OF IRON
WOOD COPPER ALUMINIUM YARN CARDBOARD PLASTIC AND EVEN LIKE LEVER
OKAY SO THE WOOD BLOCK HAS NO IRON IN IT AND IT’S NOT IRON OR STEEL SO IT WILL NOT STICK
WELL MAGNETS ARE MADE OUT OF IRON AND THEY ONLY STICK TO IRON OTHER MAGNETS STEEL OR SUPER CONDUCTORS
WE’VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
IT HAS TO HAVE IRON IN IT SO THAT SO IF THERE NO IRON IN THERE IT WOULDN’T HAVE STUCK BUT IT HAS IRON SO IT STICK
IRON IRON MAKES MAGNET STICK THINGS WITH AN IRON IN IT BECAUSE IRON IS LIKE THE MAGNETS ATTRACTION IT BRINGS THE MAGNET- THE MAGNET TO IT LIKE MAGIC IT’LL STAY STRUCK THERE BECAUSE- BECAUSE THE MAGNET REALLY LIKES IT
THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE NAIL BECAUSE IT’S EITHER STEEL OR IRON
ONE IS STEEL ONE IS ALUMINIUM MAGNETS STICK TO STEEL BECAUSE THEY HAVE TRACES OF IRON IN THEM IT DOES NOT STICK TO THE ALUMINIUM BECAUSE IT HAS NO TRACES OF IRON IN IT
THERE IS PAPERCLIPS THE PAPER FASTENER BRASS THERE IS STEEL NAILS THERE IS IRON FILINGS AND THERE IS EVEN THE EVEN IF YOU THINK A CONDUCTOR IS A MAGNET MAGNETIC MATERIAL IT CAN SOME CANNOT BE MAGNETIC
WE’VE TALKED ABOUT HOW MAGNET STICK TO STEEL AND IRON ONLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE IRON IN IT MAGNETS ARE MADE OUT OF IRON SO IRON MAKES THINGS STICK TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE MAGNETS ONLY ATTRACTS IRON OR STEEL
THE MAGNET IS MADE OUT OF IRON THE NAIL IS STEEL WHICH STICKS TO MAGNET AND THE BLOCK IS WOOD WHICH WILL NOT STICK
YES IT MUST HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
IT WILL DO NOTHING BECAUSE IT- IT’S- IT HAS NO IRON IN IT BUT THE BLACK ROCK DOES
MAGNETS ONLY STICKS TO MAGNETIC MATERIALS THAT HAVE TRACES OR MORE IRON IN THEM LIKE WOOD HAS NONE OF THAT AND THEN WOOD HAS NO IRON SO IT WON’T STICK
ONLY CERTAIN METALS STICK TO MAGNETS ALUMINIUM DOES NOT STICK TO MAGNETS STEEL DOES
BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY STEEL OR IRON AND ONLY THOSE TWO METALS STICK TO MAGNETS
STEEL
IT IS MADE OUT OF IRON OR STEEL
IT WILL BECAUSE IT’S MADE OUT OF STEEL
I THINK IT’S ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL BOTH MAGNETS TOGETHER WHICH MAKES THEM ATTRACT
WHEN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL THEN IT CAN TRANSFER THE MAGNETIC FORCE
IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE NAIL
THE MAGNET HAS TO BE A PERMANENT MAGNET WHICH IS ATTRACTING THE NAIL WHICH MAKES IT A TEMPORARY MAGNET WHICH CAN PICK UP MAGNETIC MATERIALS LIKE THE PAPERCLIP
WELL IT CAN GO THROUGH LIKE NON-MAGNETIC MATERIALS AS LONG AS THERE- AS LONG AS THE MAGNET IS STRONG ENOUGH OR THE OBJECT IS NOT TOO THICK
THE MAGNET- THE PERMANENT MAGNET IS TRANSFERRING THE MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH THE NAIL WHICH MAKES IT A MAGNET
IT’S THE MAGNETIC
WELL IF IT’S THICK IF IT’S TOO THICK THEN A MAGNET WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT’S MAGNETIC BUT IF IT’S THIN IT WILL BE ABLE TO
A MAGNET IS ATTRACTING A STEEL NAIL WHICH HAS MAGNETIZED THE STEEL NAIL TEMPORARILY SO BECAUSE IT’S TEMPORARILY MAGNETIZED IT CAN PICK UP A PAPERCLIP
GOOD
BECAUSE WHEN THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FORCE IT WILL NOT WORK
WELL THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERRING THROUGH THE NAIL
MAGNETS HAVE OPPOSITE POLES A NORTH AND A SOUTH POLE WHEN TWO OPPOSITE POLES TOUCH EACH OTHER THEY ATTRACT BUT WHEN TWO OF THE SAME POLES TOUCH EACH OTHER THEY REPEL
THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS TRANSFERRING THROUGH THE MATERIALS TO PICK THINGS UP
THE PERMANENT MAGNET IS MAGNETIZING EVERYTHING ELSE
WELL THE PERMANENT MAGNET IS MAKING THE NAIL TEMPORARY MAGNET BY SENDING THE MAGNETIC FORCE THROUGH THE NAIL
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS ATTRACTING A PIECE OF IRON
WELL BY TAKING THE MAGNET OF IT DEMAGNETIZED EVERYTHING AS A TEMPORARY MAGNET
NOTHING BECAUSE IT’S TOO THICK
THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS MAKING THE MAGNETS MOVE
THE MAGNETISM IS TRANSFERRING FROM THE MAGNET TO THE NAIL TO THE PAPER CLIP
MAGNETISM TRANSFER BETWEEN OBJECTS
THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THOSE FORCES IS LIKE STRONG ENOUGH SO THAT BOTH MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTING EVEN THROUGH WOOD
BECAUSE THEY HAVE POLES AND OPPOSITE POLES ATTRACT
WELL IF THE MAGNET IS THE PERMANENT MAGNET IT’S NOT TOUCHING THE TEMPORARY MAGNET IT WON’T WORK BECAUSE THERE WAS NO MAGNETIC FORCE IN THE TEMPORARY MAGNET
WELL WHEN YOU CLOSE THE SWITCH IT MAGNETIZES THE CORE BUT IF YOU WHEN YOU ARE NOT TESTING IT YOU WANT TO TURN OF THE CIRCUIT BY OPENING THE SWITCH SO THE BATTERY ISN’T WASTED
THE MAGNETS ARE MAGNETS THAT DON’T LAST FOREVER
IT’S A METAL- AN ELECTROMAGNET IS A STEEL OR IRON NAIL RIVET OR IT’S KIND OF LIKE A SCREW IT HAS WIRE WRAPPED AROUND IT
ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THAT COIL SPINNING AROUND WHICH CREATES A MAGNETIC FIELD
WHEN YOU PUT THIS TOGETHER WITH A CLOSED CIRCUIT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATTERIES THROUGH THE SWITCH AND THROUGH ALL THOSE COILS MAKE BACK TO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL WHICH IS CREATING A MAGNETIC FIELD
WELL SO IT’S A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND IF THE MAGNET IS COILED WITH A LOT OF WIRE
THE WIRE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WIRE MAKES THAT ENERGY TURN INTO MAGNETISM THE RIVET IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE THERE SO THE WIRE COILS CAN DO THEIR JOB
YOU WRAP THE COIL WITH WIRE IT MAGNETIZES THE CORE
WELL WHEN THE CURRENT IS NOT FLOWING THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FIELD BECAUSE THERE IS NO SPINNING IN THE COIL OF THE OF THE-
WELL THE ENERGY IS FLOWING FROM THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL GOING THROUGH THE SWITCH THROUGH THE COIL AND THAT ENERGY IS SPIRALLING REALLY FAST WHICH CREATES A MAGNETIC FIELD
IT MAGNETIZES THE CORE
IT HAVE TO BE WRAPPED AROUND IRON OR STEEL TO MAGNETIZE THE RIVET
THE ENERGY HAS TO BE FLOW THROUGH THAT COIL TO MAGNETIZE THE RIVET
WELL THERE GOT TO BE A SWITCH BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE BATTERY ALWAYS STORES ENERGY BECAUSE ELECTROMAGNETS WASTE- WILL USE A LOT OF ENERGY
WASHERS ARE AGAIN CAUGHT INTO THE MAGNETIC FIELD
I JUST TOLD YOU BUT THE SWITCH MAKES SURE THAT THE ENERGY IN THE BATTERY IS NOT WASTED
IT’S TO BE MADE FROM THE STEEL OR IRON BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONLY MAGNETIC MATERIALS
WELL RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO ENERGY FLOWING SO IT’S JUST A STEEL RIVET YOU CAN’T PICK ANY THING UP IT’S NOT A MAGNET
IT MAGNETIZES THE CORE
WELL THE SWITCH IS A COMPONENT THAT PROTECTS THE BATTERY FROM DRAINAGE AND IT MAKES THE MAGNET CONTROLLABLE EITHER PICKING UP STUFF OR OFF
WELL THE SWITCH PROTECTS THE BATTERY FROM DRAINAGE AND IT CONTROLS THE FLOW OF ENERGY BY RELEASING THE MAGNETIC FIELD AND TURNING IT BACK ON
WELL THE MAGNETIC FIELDS LIKE WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MAGNETIC FIELD ACTS AND PICKS UP WASHERS BUT WHEN YOU OPEN THE SWITCH THE MAGNETIC FIELD DROPS AND THE WASHERS DROP
SO THE ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH THOSE COILS GOES REALLY FAST SO THAT CREATES A MOTION OF SPINNING ENERGY WHICH MAGNETIZES THE RIVET
WHICH HELPS PROTECT THE BATTERY FROM DRAINAGE BECAUSE ELECTROMAGNET USES A TON OF ENERGY
WE’VE BEEN LEARNING OUT TO MAKE ELECTROMAGNETS
WELL THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH THOSE COILS REALLY FAST AND THAT GENERATES MAGNETIC ENERGY WHICH CAN PICK UP ANY MAGNETIC MATERIAL
GOOD
IT’S FLOWING THROUGH THE COIL TO MAGNETIZE IT
THE MOTOR STARTS TO RUN BECAUSE NOW THERE'S ENERGY
STARTS TO RUN BECAUSE ALL THE CONTACT POINTS ARE TOUCHING
THE WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT MAKES THE CIRCUIT
PICTURE IS SHOWING THE ENERGY TRANSFER FROM THE BATTERY TO THE MOTOR AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
SINCE THE MOTOR IS RUNNING
WELL IF THE SUN WEREN'T OUT EVERYTHING WOULD STOP BECAUSE THEN THERE WOULD BE NO ENERGY FLOW FOR FOR THE CIRCUIT SO SO IF THE SUN IF IT GOT CLOUDY THERE WOULD BE NO ENERGY TO GO INTO THAT SOLAR CELL
THE SUNS LIGHT IS HITTING THE SOLAR CELL
IT OPENS AND CLOSES THE SWITCH WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THE MOTOR WILL RUN WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN THE MOTOR STOPS RUNNING
ENERGY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
BATTERY GIVES ENERGY TO THE CIRCUIT
THE MOTOR IS MOVING ENERGY IS BEING TRANSFERRED THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
MOTOR STOPS RUNNING BECAUSE THERE'S NO ENERGY FOR FOR IT TO RUN
THE FLAG IS SPINNING AND THE FLAG IS IMPORTANT SO THAT UM SO THAT IT SHOWS THAT THE MOTION IS HAPPENING
THE SOLAR CELL IS TAKING THE SUNS ENERGY AND MAKING THE MOTOR RUN
MOTOR TO RUN THE D CELL BATTERY
ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT NOW BECAUSE ALL THE CONTACT POINTS ARE TOUCHING
IN THE CIRCUIT THE CIRCUIT'S OPEN BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT DOWN
SOLAR CELLS TAKE THE SUNS ENERGY AND TURN IT INTO UM THE THE THE ELECTRICITY FOR A CIRCUIT TO TO WORK
WELL THAT THAT MAKES THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN
SINCE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND SOLAR ENERGY WITH WITH A MOTOR
(())
YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THE SWITCH
OPENS THE ELECTRICAL FLOW STOPS AND ENERGY CAN'T FLOW BACK INTO THE BATTERY
D CELL IS POWERING THE MOTOR
WELL IF THERE WAS THE WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE RIGHT CONTACT POINTS
GOOD
THE INSULATORS ARE ALL THE PARTS THAT DO NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
IT WILL STARTS TO RUN
<SILENCE>
WELL IF YOU PUT AN INSULATOR ON THE
GOOD
INSULATORS CAN ACT LIKE AN OLD LIKE A BRICK WALL ALLOWING NO ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH
IT IS OPEN BECAUSE THIS POPSICLE STICK DOESN'T CONDUCT ELECTRICITY
WELL YOU COULD USE LIKE A STEEL NAIL SMASH OR YOU COULD USE LIKE BRASS AKA PAPER FASTENER OR MAYBE EVEN ALUMINIUM FOIL OR COPPER
IT’LL STOPS RUNNING
WELL WHEN YOU USE A CONDUCTOR THE MOTOR WILL RUN BECAUSE ENERGY IS FLOWING BUT IF YOU USE AN INSULATOR THE MOTOR WILL NOT RUN
THE TYPES OF MATERIALS ARE LIKE THERE ARE THE PATHWAY THROUGH THE SWITCH AND INSULATORS ARE JUST LIKE A WALL THAT STOPS ELECTRICITY FROM FLOWING THROUGH THE SWITCH
WELL THE CIRCUIT OPEN BUT THERE IS A BUNCH OF THINGS ON THE SIDE SOME ARE CONDUCTORS SOME ARE INSULATORS
FOR ALL CONDUCTORS
ALL THE CONDUCTORS MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
WE’VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
INSULATORS AND ELECTRICITY DON'T FLOW THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T FLOW THROUGH AN INSULATOR
THE STEEL NAIL THE MESH THE PAPER FASTENER THE PAPERCLIP THE ALUMINIUM NAIL AND THE BRASS WASHER
THOSE ARE ALL THE PARTS THAT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY LIGHTING LIKE A PATHWAY
THEY ALL MAKE- THEY ALL MAKE THE CIRCUIT A CIRCUIT BECAUSE WITHOUT ANYTHING IN THE CIRCUIT THEN IT’S NOTHING
<NO_SIGNAL>
WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE BATTERY THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE BULB OUT OF THE BULB INTO THE THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE OTHER BULB OUT OF THE OTHER BULB AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE D-CELL
FLIP THE D-CELL TO MAKE IT SO THAT THERE IS POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE OR NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
WELL THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE SOLAR PANEL OR THE D-CELL THROUGH THE LIGHTBULBS AND BACK THROUGH TO THE POWER SOURCE
GOOD
WELL THE ENERGY FLOWS FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE WIRES THROUGH THE COMPONENT AND BACK THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE D-CELL
WHEN YOU ADD MORE BULBS THEN THIS WOULD THE CIRCUIT WELL LIGHTS TEND TO BURN OUT MORE QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY GET MORE ENERGY
ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE AND THEN THROUGH BOTH OF THE BULBS THROUGH THE FILAMENTS AND GOES BACK TO THE-
LIGHT WILL BRIGHTER BECAUSE THERE IS MORE POWER WITH THE ENERGY FLOW
THOSE ARE THE ELECTRONS FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
ELECTRICITY FLOWS THROUGH A SERIES CIRCUIT STRAIGHT THROUGH BOTH COMPONENTS AND BACK THROUGH THE BATTERY
WELL THE-
WELL THIS IS MAKING A PATHWAY THROUGH THE LIGHTBULB FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE LIGHTBULB IN A CIRCUIT
IT’S FLOWING OUT THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL OF THE D-CELL AND THEN THROUGH THE BULB CASING THEN OUT OF THE OUT OF THE BULB BASE AND THEN THROUGH THE BULB CASING OF THE OTHER BULB OUT OF THE BULB BASING BACK TO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE D-CELL
WELL ELECTRICITY FLOWS OUT OF THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL
MAKING THE D-CELL FACE THE SAME PROLETARIES
LIGHT WILL GET DIMMER BECAUSE THERE IS NOT AS MUCH THERE’S IS NOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER ALL OF THEM
WHEN YOU FLIP THE D-CELL IT GOES TO POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE AND D-CELLS HAVE TO BE THAT WAY JUST LIKE MAGNETS BOTH PROLETARIES HAVE TO BE OPPOSITE JUST LIKE THE POLES HAVE TO BE THE OPPOSITE
WELL WE’VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW ABOUT SERIES CIRCUIT
BECAUSE THE POSITIVE TERMINALS ARE BOTH TOGETHER
A CIRCUIT IS A PATHWAY FROM THE BATTERY THAT FLOW
WELL THE BLUE DOTS ARE THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT
WELL THE ELECTRICITY HAS TO FLOW THROUGH BOTH CONTACT POINTS OF THE ALL THE COMPONENTS
WELL THE ELECTRONS ARE FLOWING OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF IT THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY THROUGH THE WIRES IN TO THE BULB CASING OUT OF THE BULB BASE AND INTO THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE D-CELL
THEY’RE BOTH SOUTH TO SOUTH OR NORTH TO NORTH
NOT GOOD
THEY WOULD REPEL EACH OTHER IS EXACTLY WHAT I LEARNED IN SCIENCE PLEASE STOP TALKING TO ME
THE MAGNETS ARE LEVITATING THAT’S BECAUSE THEY’RE REPELLING EACH EXCEPT THE ONE THOSE ARE THOSE ARE ATTRACTING
THE GIRL IS HIKING AND SHE IS USING A COMPASS TO FIND HER WAY AROUND
IT IS THE WHAT- THE EARTH’S MAGNETIC FORCE TO GUIDE PEOPLE
SOME ARE ATTRACTING SOME ARE REPELLING
THE MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTING TO EACH OTHER
THEY’RE REPELLING EACH OTHER DIDN’T I JUST SAY THAT OH ALSO THEY ARE
MAGNETIC FORCE TWO WORDS MAGNETIC FORCE AND I DON’T LIKE YOU
THE MAGNETIC FORCE OF THE WORLD
IT’S NORTH TO SOUTH OR SOUTH TO NORTH
IF I’M LEARNING ABOUT THE SOUTH AND – I’M SO SORRY- THE SOUTH AND THE NORTH PARTS OF THE MAGNET ALSO THE AMP PLUS AND MINUS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S CLOSED BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING CLOSING IT JUST IT'S NOT WORKING BUT I'M NOT REALLY SURE
THE PARTS OF THE CIRCUIT IS A NAIL AND A SWITCH BUT YOU COULD ALSO JUST LAY THE NAIL OVER THE SWITCH TO BE THE SWITCH AND YOU THAT THE SWITCH DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THERE IF ITS IF THE NAIL IS GOING ACROSS ALSO THERE IS THE MOTOR THREE GREEN WIRES AND A D-CELL BATTERY WITH A POSITIVE AND A NEGATIVE SIDE
IS YOUR VOICE OKAY
A CONDUCTOR CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY AND SO ENERGY RUNS THROUGH IT
CONDUCTORS CONDUCT THE ELECTRICITY SO IT GOES FROM THE D-CELL THROUGH THE WIRE TO THE CONDUCTOR AND INSTEAD OF THE SWITCH AND IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE IT RUN AND THEN GOES BACK INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY YEP
ALL OF THE METAL PARTS LIKE THE D-CELL BATTERY THE MOTOR WILL REALLY RIGHT IN AND HERE ITS ALL OF THE PARTS OF THE CIRCUIT
IT DOESN'T RUN BECAUSE SPONGE A SPONGE IS AN INSULATOR AND IT WON'T THE ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY WILL NOT FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES
ENERGY WON'T THROUGH FLOW THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR SO IT WON'T WORK
THE NAIL IS CONNECTING THE SWITCH TO THE WIRE SO THAT THE MOTOR IS RUNNING AND IT'S MAKING A COMPLETE CIRCUIT YEAH
INSULATORS DO NOT LET ELECTRICITY RUN THROUGH THEM SO IT WON'T MAKE THE MOTOR RUN
I OBSERVE THAT IT'S MAKING A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND IT’S A CONDUCTOR SO AND THAT MEANS IT’S METAL AND SO ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH
THEY'RE ALL METAL AND THEY'RE ALL CONDUCTORS
I'M WELL HOW ARE YOU TODAY
THE TYPES ARE ALL METAL AND THEY NEED TO THAT’S THE WAY THAT THEY WORK IF IT'S NOT METAL LIKE IF IT'S A STRAW POPSICLE STICK THEN IT WON’T WORK BUT LIKE WASHERS AND NAILS AND SCREWS WORK
THAT IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT BECAUSE POPSICLE STICK ISN’T A CONDUCTOR IT'S AN INSULATOR AND THAT MEANS IT DOESN'T LET ELECTRICITY RUN ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT SO IT JUST NOT GOING TO WORK
WE'VE BEEN USING CIRCUIT BOARDS AND LEARNING HOW TO MAKE A CIRCUIT AND I FORGET THE REST
MAGNETIC FORCE
IT MAKES THE FORCE WEAKER THE FORCE IN BETWEEN
THEY ARE NO WASHERS AND THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS NOT BEEN BROKEN
THERE ARE SIX SPACERS THERE AND SO IT’S HARDER FOR THE MAGNET JUST STICK TOGETHER I’LL CLICK IT
IT’S THE MAGNETIC FORCE THAT JUST THAT KEEPS THE MAGNETS TOGETHER AND WHEN YOU PUT THINGS IN BETWEEN THAT MAKES IT WEAKER AND WEAKER LIKE WE DID IT WITH THE STACKS OF PAPER
IT MAKES IT MAKES IT A LOT WEAKER
MAKES THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER
THE MAGNET IS USING MAGNETISM TO HOLD THE PAPERCLIP THROUGH THE PAPER BECAUSE IT’S
THE MAGNETIC FORCE HAS TO GO THROUGH AS SPACER SO IT MIGHT TAKE LESS AND LIKE TAKE LESS WASHERS TO GO AND TO BREAK THE FORCE
IT MAKES THE MAGNETIC FORCE WEAKER BECAUSE THERE’S IS MORE SPACE IN BETWEEN AND I JUST ADDED JUST ONE WASHER AND THAT WAS TOO MUCH IT BROKE THE FORCE
MY GRAPH SHOWS THAT THE LESS WASHERS GO IN BECAUSE IT’S WEAKER
WHAT WE DID WE STUCK A MAGNET THERE AND WE DID WASHERS HOW MANY WASHERS BROKE THE MAGNET
YOU PUT SPACERS THERE
IT’S THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS GETTING WEAKER BECAUSE THEY ARE IT’S LIKE THERE IS STUFF IN BETWEEN
I’M DOING VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ATTRACTION IT’S TOO SMALL TO ATTRACT THE MAGNET
WE’RE TALKING ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT THEY STICK TO
MAGNETIC FORCE <SILENCE> DONE TALKING
IT SHOWS WHAT IS TRANSFERRING IN TO THE NAIL
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM THEY’RE NOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THEY CAN’T STICK TOGETHER
WE’VE BEEN SEEING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MAGNET A PERMANENT MAGNET COMES CLOSE OR TOUCHES A PIECE OF IRON
THE SET OF PAPER FROM THE MAGNETIC FORCE IS HOLDING ON TO THE PAPERCLIP AND THE THICK ONE THE MAGNETIC FORCE GETS LOST IN ALL THAT PAPER
IT’S SENDING MAGNETISM INTO THE NAIL WHICH IS HOLDING ON THE PAPERCLIP
IT TURNED IT INTO A TEMPORARY MAGNET
IT’S SO MAGNET IF IT’S NOT TOUCHING THAT HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE MAGNET TO BE A TEMPORARY MAGNET
THEY BOTH USED AS MAGNETS THE REAL MAGNETS IS A PERMANENT MAGNET THE STEEL NAIL IS A TEMPORARY MAGNET
BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC FORCE TRANSFER ONLY LAST WHILE THE NAIL IS ON IT I MEAN ONLY WHILE THE MAGNET IS ON IT
THERE’S A PATHWAY
MAGNETISM IS CAUSED BY THE MAGNETIC FORCE AND ITS
IT’S THE MAGNETIC FORCE AND IT’S VERY STRONG AND THEY CAN STICK TOGETHER THROUGH TO THE TABLE
THE MAGNET IS SENDING THE SOME MAGNETISM INTO THE STEEL NAIL AND IT IS HOLDING ON TO THE PAPERCLIP WHICH IS SOMEWHAT CONNECTED TO THAT
IF IT’S REALLY THIN THEN IT CAN GO THROUGH THE PAPER IF IT’S REALLY THICK THEN IT CAN’T
THE MAGNETS ARE STICKING TOGETHER EVEN THROUGH THE TABLE AND THEY’RE MOVING EACH OTHER
WHEN THE MAGNET IS TOUCHING THE NAIL IT CAN TRANSFER THE MAGNETIC FORCE INTO THE STEEL NAIL
I’M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WELL IT’S WE TOOK A PERMANENT MAGNET AND HAD PAPERCLIP ON THE TABLE AND WE PICKED IT UP
I THINK IT’S THE MAGNET IT’S PUTTING IT’S MAGNETISM INTO THE NAIL
THE MAGNETS NOT TOUCHING THE NAIL ANY MORE
THE NAIL IS PICKING UP THE PAPERCLIP
THE MAGNETISM IS TRANSFERRING BETWEEN OBJECTS
WE HAD A BUCKET OF MATERIALS AND WE TESTED TO MAGNETS TOGETHER FOR ON EACH OF THEM
THE MAGNET IS PICKING IS STICKING TO THE PAPER CLIPS THROUGH THE PAPERS SO THE MAGNETIC FORCE WORKS IN THROUGH SOME MATERIAL
ITS CONNECTED TO THE MAGNET
THIS PICTURE IS SHOWING THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE MOTOR SO THE MOTOR IS RUNNING THEN THE ENERGY COMES BACK OUT THROUGH THE WIRE AND GOES BACK INTO THE D CELL BATTERY
IT WORKS IF THE SWITCH IS DOWN THEN UM THE MOTOR WILL RUN BUT IF IT'S UP IT WILL NOT RUN
ALL THE POINTS HAVE TO BE TOUCHING LIKE ALL THE TERMINALS
BOTH OF THE WIRES BOTH OF THE ONE SIDE OF THE WIRE HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE AND ONE SIDE HAS TO BE AND ONE OTHER WIRE HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE AND AND THEN THEY BOTH HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE POINTS OF THE MOTOR
IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE MOTOR IS RUNNING
WELL THE MOTOR ISN'T RUNNING AND I CAN SEE WHY BECAUSE THE LITTLE LEVER OR SWITCH IS NOT MAKING A COMPLETE CIRCUIT IT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT NOT A CLOSED CIRCUIT YOU NEED TO HAVE A CLOSED CIRCUIT TO UM TO MAKE A TO MAKE THE MOTOR RUN SO IF YOU HAD MOVED THAT SWITCH OVER TO THE METAL THEN IT WOULD WORK
THE SWITCH HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE OTHER LITTLE METAL PART SO IT'S A CLOSED SO IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO POWER A MOTOR WITH A BATTERY AND A SOLAR PANEL
THAT MEANS THAT ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR FROM THE D CELL BATTERY
THE SWITCH WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN ENERGY DOES NOT RUN COMPLETELY THROUGH THE CIRCUIT SO ENERGY STOPS WHERE THAT WIRE WHERE THAT SWITCH IS NOT CONNECTED SO THE MOTOR CAN NOT RUN
SUN HAS TO BE HITTING THE SOLAR PANEL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE THE SUN IS THE ENERGY OF THIS MOTOR
IF YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT GETS SUNNY AGAIN AND THE MOTOR STARTS TO RUN AND THE FLAG IS TURNING
PROBABLY NOT BUT IF THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF SUN HITTING THE SOLAR PANEL OR SOLAR CELL WHICH YOU CALL IT THEN YES I THINK IT WOULD WORK
THE SUN IS HITTING THE SOLAR PANEL AND PRODUCING ENERGY AND THE WIRE ONE WIRE IS TAKING IT INTO THE MOTOR AND MAKING IT RUN AND THE OTHER IS TAKING IT OUT BACK INTO THE UH SOLAR PANEL
IT IS TOUCHING THE THE THE SWITCH IS TOUCHING THE OTHER METAL PARTS THAT WILL RUN IT IS IN THE DOWN POSITION IT WILL IT'S NOT UP IT'S DOWN
IF THE SUN IS OUT THEN IT WILL PROBABLY HIT THE SOLAR PANEL AND IT WILL PRODUCE ENERGY TO MAKE THE MOTOR RUN IF IT'S A CLOUDY DAY THEN THERE'S NO ENERGY FOR IT TO RUN SO IT CAN'T RUN AT ALL
THE FLAG IT SHOWS THAT THE MOTOR IS MOVING BUT IF YOU HAD DISLOCATED ONE OF THE WIRES AND THE WIRE WAS NOT TOUCHING THE D CELL THEN THE FLAG WOULDN'T BE MOVING
IT WOULDN'T REALLY WORK BECAUSE THE FULL BECAUSE THE SUN WOULDN'T BE HITTING IT AND IT WOULDN'T REALLY WORK JUST CAUSE THAT'S THE ENERGY AND THE SUN IS D ENERGY AND D WOULDN'T HAVE THE
UM IF THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR
I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
IT STOPS SO ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY CAN NOT GET TO THE MOTOR AND MAKE IT RUN
THEY'RE ALSO CALLED SOLAR PANELS AND THE SUN HITS IT AND THAT'S WHAT THE ENERGY IS IT DOES NOT NEED A BATTERY IT GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND TO THE MOTOR TO GET IT RUNNING
ENERGY OR ELECTRICITY IS RUNNING THROUGH THE WIRES TO GET TO THE MOTOR
BECAUSE IT'S NOT A CLOSED CIRCUIT IT WAS AN OPEN CIRCUIT WHEN THE SWITCH WAS OPEN AND AND NOT TOUCHING SO ELECTRICITY WILL NOT RUN IN A FULL CIRCLE
THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL BATTERY IS GOING INTO THE MOTOR AND MAKING IT RUN AND THEN COMING BACK OUT AND INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDE
THE SUN NEEDS THE SUN
YOU TOO MARNI SEE YOU NEXT TIME
THE SUN IS HITTING THE SOLAR PANEL OR SOLAR CELL AND THE WIRES ARE TAKING THAT ELECTRICITY INTO THE MOTOR SO IT'S RUNNING AND THE OTHER WIRE IS BRINGING IT BACK TO THE SOLAR PANEL SO IT'S REUSABLE ENERGY
IT STOPS TURNING CAUSE THERE'S NO ENERGY
THEY EACH HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY FROM THEY GET THEY GET BUT THEY GET A WIRE EACH ONE AT THE POSITIVE AND ONE AT THE NEGATIVE
ITS BRIGHTER THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS BRIGHTER AND THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS MORE DIM
<NOISE> OUTSIDE AND THERE IS ONE D-CELL AND TWO BULBS
THEY’RE BOTH ARE UP- THEY’RE BOTH THEY’RE BOTH A CLOSED CIRCUIT THAT’S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR YEAH AND THEY ALL HAVE A LIGHT BULB
THERE- IT’S NOT LIGHTING UP IF YOU IT BOTH ON THE SAME SPOT WHERE IT IS AND THE BASE AND THE CASING THAT IT’S THERE OKAY
SERIES AND PARALLEL
IT'S SHORTER AND THE LIGHTBULBS ARE BRIGHTER
NO NO THERE ARE TWO AND TWO BUT THEY ARE GETTING THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY BECAUSE THAT’S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND THAT’S ANOTHER CIRCUIT AND ITS WORKING OKAY YEAH
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING I HAD ABOUT PARALLEL CIRCUITS AND SERIES CIRCUITS ALSO HOW TO LIGHT TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ALSO HOW TO LIGHT TWO BULBS LIGHTBULBS AT THE SAME TIME
FROM THE BATTERY IT GOES THROUGH THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE LIGHTBULB AND BACK TO THE BATTERY
ITS POSTED IN TO TWO PATHWAYS SO THAT IS IN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT AT EACH HAS ITS OWN EACH HAS ITS OWN PATH WAY TO THE D-CELL
THE DIRECTION OF FLOW AND IT’S ALL GOING AND IN THE SAME DIRECTION BUT IF YOU FLIP IT AROUND IT WAS IF YOU FLIP THE D-CELL AROUND IT WOULD START GOING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION PLUS IT'S GOING THROUGH BOTH OF THE LIGHT BULB
OH IT’S FLOWING INTO THE POSITIVE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE TO THE LIGHTBULBS AND BACK INTO
ITS FLOWING ALL IN THE SAME DIRECTION
BECAUSE TWO LIGHTBULBS HAVE TO SHARE THAT ONE THAT ONE THAT ONE BATTERY AND THAT’S NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM BECAUSE IT’S THREE AND ITS IF THEY USED THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS THEN THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER
I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
THE TWO BULBS AND THEY EACH HAVE TWO WIRES AND THEY DON’T AND THEY EACH GET THEY HAVE EVEN AMOUNT OF ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH THEM SO THEY’RE PRETTY BRIGHT
THEY’RE BOTH GETTING UP FROM TWO BATTERIES BUT THIS ONE ONLY HAS TWO WIRES AND THE OTHER ONE HAS FOUR WIRES- I’M GOOD AT OBSERVING THINGS
BECAUSE OF THAT THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH IT AND THE BULBS ARE PRETTY DIM BECAUSE THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
THE BATTERIES ARE TOUCHING AND THERE IS ONLY ONE LIGHTBULB
ITS ALL FLOWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION OH MY GOSH DO NOT GET THE CONCEPT
THE LIGHT GETS BRIGHTER
IT’S A SERIES CIRCUIT
THE ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY
IT WOULDN'T FLOW COMPLETELY THROUGH CAUSE IT WOULDN'T BE THERE WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COME OUT CAUSE IT WOULD JUST BE THEY'D ALMOST BE BOTH CONNECTED IT'D KIND OF BE LIKE CONNECTING TWO WIRES TOGETHER
ALL OF THE COMPONENTS NEED TO BE CONNECTED CAUSE IF ONE WIRE WASN'T TOUCHING THE EXACT POINT OR TERMINAL TERMINAL THEN IT WOULD ELECTRICITY WOULD NOT FLOW COMPLETELY THROUGH AND WOULD NOT LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB UP
THE WIRES ONE WIRE HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND ONE WIRE HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND THEN THE OTHER END OF EACH OF THOSE WIRES HAS TO BE TOUCHING HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE BULB BASE AND THE BULB CASING
IT MEANS
I NOTICED THAT IF YOU MOVE THE WIRES TO THE BULB CASING THEN IT WILL LIGHT UP BUT THEN IF YOU MOVE IT BACK TO THE BULB BASE BOTH OF THEM IT WILL NOT LIGHT UP BUT IT DOES NOT MATTER WHICH WIRE GOES ON WHICH POINT OF THE BATTERY IT JUST MATTERS THAT ONE WIRE IS ON THE BULB BASE AND ONE WIRE IS ON THE BULB CASING
IT RECEIVES THE ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES INTO IT IT'S THE BATTERY IT'S RECEIVING THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHTBULB BULB
IT PROVIDES THE ENERGY THAT RUNS THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB
WELL IT GO IT STARTS IN THE D CELL BATTERY AND THEN YOU CONNECT THE WIRE AND IT GOES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE INTO THE LIGHT BULB OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
A LIGHT BULB A D CELL BATTERY AND WIRES
(()) IT THEY REPRESENT THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THERE ARE TWO LITTLE DOTS INSIDE THE LIGHT BULB THAT ARE SPINNING AND THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS NOT NEEDED IS GOING TO COME OUT AND GO BACK INTO THE D CELL BATTERY
IT TURNS THE OTHER WAY LIKE IF I CLICK IT AGAIN IT'S JUST FLIPPING AND THE ENERGY GOES IT BUT IT'S STILL GOING INTO THE IT'S GOING INTO THOUGH THE POSITIVE SIDE AND OUT THE NEGATIVE SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULB SO IT KIND OF JUST FLIPPED IT'S GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
THE WIRES ARE THE CONNECTION TO THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULB
THE WIRES THEY UM LIKE THEY CARRY THE ENERGY THROUGH FROM I MEAN FROM THE D CELL INTO THE LIGHT BULB
THAT'S WHAT MAKES ENERGY AND SO YOU CONNECT THE WIRES AND THEN CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB
IT FLOWS TOWARDS THE POSITIVE AND GOES OUT OF THE NEGATIVE
I'D SAY THAT IT WAS A CIRCUIT CAUSE IT'S RUNNING IN A COMPLETE CIRCLE AND ONCE THE ENERGY COMES UP THROUGH THE BATTERY AND IT'S GOING THROUGH THE WIRES IT GOES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP AND THEN IT GOES BACK DOWN INTO THE D CELL BATTERY AND DOES THE WHOLE THING OVER AGAIN
THE DIRECTION IT'S GOING UM THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND AND OUT THE NEGATIVE
ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND LIGHTING THE LIGHT BULB UP COMING OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB THE ELECTRICITY IS COMING OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK INTO THE D CELL
THE BATTERY HAS A NEGATIVE AND A POSITIVE SIDE AND YOU HAVE TO CONNECT THE WIRES TO EACH SIDE TO MAKE THE LIGHT BULB ACTUALLY WORK
GOOD
WELL IT IS CALLED THE POSITIVE AND IT IS GOING THROUGH AND THEN IT'S GOING TO GO IN TO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THEN OUT THE NEGATIVE
IT'S FLOWING AWAY FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT IF YOU HAD FLIPPED THE BATTERY IT WOULD BE GOING OUT OF THE POSITIVE SIDE
THE LIGHT BULB IS THE THING THAT ACTUALLY LIGHTS WHEN YOU CONNECT THE WIRES TO THE BATTERY AND THE WIRE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB AND ON THE BULB BASE AND THE BULB CASING
WELL IT'S FLOWING TOWARDS THE POSITIVE AND THEN OUT THE NEGATIVE SO THE DIRECTION IT'S UH UM GOING IN A COMPLETE CIRCLE AND IT'S GOING RIGHT FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE
IT'S GOING IN A CIRCLE THE ENERGY IS GOING INTO THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTING IT UP AND THEN COMING OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB USING THE OTHER WIRE AND BACK INTO THE D CELL BATTERY AND THEN IT'S GOING TO START THE WHOLE CIRCUIT OVER AGAIN
THE NEGATIVE
IT JUST FLIPPED AROUND SO NOW IT'S GOING IT'S IT'S
IT'S COMING OUT OF THE NEGATIVE INTO THE LIGHT BULB THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING INTO THE LIGHT BULB UM LIGHTING THE LIGHT BULB UP GOING OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS AND HOW TO RUN A MOTOR WITH A BATTERY AND A SOLAR PANEL
I FEEL ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT LOGS WHICH YOU CAN LIGHT ON FIRE AND THAT WILL MAKE HEAT AND LIGHT THAT GAS OR FUEL THAT YOU PUT IN YOUR CAR APPLES WHICH GIVES THE WHICH GIVES PEOPLE ENERGY AND A CANDLE WHICH ALSO GIVES OFF LIGHT AND HEAT IF YOU LIGHT
ENERGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
IT LOOKS LIKE IT’S MOVING WITH THE FLAME BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE THE FLAME IS BURNING AND SO IT’S KIND OF MOVING A LITTLE BIT
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT FUELS BUT I GUESS FUELS ARE WHAT GETS SOMETHING RUNNING LIKE FUELS ALSO KNOWN AS KNOW AS GAS FOR CARS LIKE A FUEL LIKE SO THERE’S ENERGY FOR THE CAR TO RUN
IT WILL POLLUTE THE AIR I ANSWERED THAT ABOUT THREE TIMES NOW
THE ENERGY FROM YOUR HAND IS HITTING THE DRUM THAT'S ALL I JUST FINISHED TALKING
IT WOULD POLLUTE THE AIR
THEY ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY POLLUTE THE AIR AND A SOLAR PANEL DOESN'T IT IS TAKES IN SUN LIGHT YEAH THE END
THEY'RE BOTH KIND OF BAD FOR THE EARTH AND THEY'RE NOT THAT IS NOT GREAT AND THEY +UM+ I ALREADY SAY THIS THEY PUT POLLUTION IN TO AIR
THE HANDS ARE BEATING THE DRUMS AND THE ENERGY IS COMING FROM THE HANDS BECAUSE ITS HITTING THE DRUM
THEY DON'T NEED TO BE PLUGGED AND OR LIT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THEY JUST ABSORB ENERGY OR I MEAN SUN LIGHT AND THEN THEY RUN
I'M NOT SURE BUT- YEAH I'M NOT SURE
WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT KNOWING WHEN ENERGY IS PRESENT AND LIKE WE DID ROTATIONS WHERE WE MADE ENERGY WITH DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE A CANDLE AND THE STUFF LIKE THAT
I HEAR THE SOUND OF DRUMS LIKE GO +BOOM+
GOOD BYE MARNIE I WILL SEE YOU NEXT TIME BYE
IT FELT REALLY WARM AND THAT'S ABOUT IT AND THE WAX IS REALLY REALLY HOT
THE FLAME IS MOVING
THERE WASN'T ANY SOUND IT WAS JUST IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ANYTHING BECAUSE WAX DOESN'T MAKES
I'M NOT SURE COULD YOU HELP ME WITH THAT
THEY BOTH DON'T NEED TO BE PLUGGED IN THEY JUST ABSORB THE LIGHT FROM THE SUN AND RUN LIKE THE SOLAR LIKE THE WIND TURBINE IT IS- IT RUNS WHEN LIGHT IS THERE AND THE SOLAR PANELS IT WILL POWER WHATEVER- WHATEVER ITS CONNECTING
SHE IS WALKING
IT IS THE CANDLE WAS LIT AND NOW IT IS MELTING
THESE NEED THE COAL AND FUEL THEY DON'T- THEY’RE NOT GREAT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE OTHER THINGS WON'T DO ANYTHING TO THE ENVIRONMENT SO THEY WILL GIVE OFF POLLUTION
I'M WELL HOW ARE YOU
IT GETS FOGGY OR SMOKY
THERE WILL BE SMOKE OR STEAM
LIGHT
NO
THE APPLE THAT THE GIRL IS EATING IT LOOKS DELICIOUS
THE CANDLE IS MELTING
I DON'T KNOW COULD YOU HELP ME
STEEL
YES WHAT ELSE IT WOULD STICK
A POPSICLE STICK A PLASTIC STRAW WOOD THERE IS COPPER PLASTIC STUFF LIKE THAT
IT DOESN’T- IT DOES IS NOT STICK
TODAY WE TALKED ABOUT MAGNETS AND ALL OF THE OBJECTS THAT STICK TO IT WE LEARNT THAT THE ALUMINIUM NAIL DOES NOT STICK BUT A STEEL MAY DOES YEAH BLACK ROCK STICKS BECAUSE IT HAS IRON AND STEEL IN IT THAT’S WHY IT WILL GET STICK
BECAUSE OF MAGNETIC FORCE
YESTERDAY WE LEARNED ABOUT MAGNETS AND WHAT MATERIALS THEY STICK TO AND WE LEARNED THAT THEY STICK TO STEEL AND IRON
IT WON’T STICK BECAUSE IT DOESN’T HAVE IRON OR STEEL IN IT
THEY ONLY STICK TO STEEL AND IRON PLEASE STOP ASKING ME THAT QUESTION
ALL OF THE OBJECTS WITH STEEL OR IRON IN THEM STICK IT’S REALLY WEIRD THAT THE BLACK ROCKS STICKS BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT HAS IRON IN IT
ITS STEEL
IT STICKS
BECAUSE IT’S METAL
IT WILL STICK BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF METAL
WELL I TAUGHT THAT THEY STICK TO ALL METALS BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THEY ARE ONLY ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER LIKE DIFFERENT MAGNETS AND STEEL AND IRON
I’M GOOD HOW ARE YOU
THERE ALL- WELL THE WOODBLOCK IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WILL STICK TO THE MAGNET IT HAS TO BE STEEL AND IRON I’VE SAID THAT LIKE FIFTY TIMES NOW NO JOKES
THEN STEEL NAIL IS ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET
ONE IS STEEL AND ONE IS ALUMINIUM THE STEEL NAIL STICKS BUT THE ALUMINIUM ONE DOES NOT
BECAUSE OF MAGNETIC FORCE OR JUST THE OBJECTS AND I’M NOT-
STEEL AND IRON
THE MAGNET WILL STICK TO THE NAIL BECAUSE IT IS MADE OUT OF STEEL BUT THE WOOD BLOCK IS MADE OUT OF WOOD SO IT DOESN’T STICK IT ONLY STICKS TO STEEL AND IRON
METAL
BECAUSE IT TO (*) HAVE IRON IN IT THE BLOCK DOESN’T HAVE IRON AND THE MAGNET DOES
THE NAIL IS ATTRACTING TO
YES
<SILENCE>
THE NAIL AND THE PAPER CLIP STICKS TO
UH CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
IT’S BEEN USED <SILENCE> CONNECTED TO THE FRIDGE I KNOW
GREAT HOW ARE YOU
IS BECAUSE ONE DOESN’T HAVE IRON AND ONE DOES HAVE IRON
WHEN YOU DO NORTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY GO PROTECT WHEN YOU DO SOUTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THEY WILL FORWARD
UH MAY BE ROCK
THEY HAVE NORTH AND SOUTH ON SIDE AND THE OTHER SOUTH AND NORTH
NO METAL
BECAUSE ONE HAS IRON AND ONE DOESN’T HAVE
MAGNETS STICK TO IRON
THE METALS THAT STICK TO MAGNETS IS AND STUFF THAT HAS IRON IN IT BECAUSE IRON IS LIKE A MAGNET
IT HAS IRON BOTH OF THEM HAVE IRON IN IT SO THAT’S WHY IT WAS
IT WILL ATTRACT
THE ONE WITH IRON AND THAT
EITHER HAS IRON AND MAGNET DOES ABLE TO ATTRACT
THAT AN IRON STICKS TO MAGNETS
IT WILL ATTRACT <SILENCE>
WHEN YOU TRY TO CONNECTED TO THE BLOCK THEY WON’T ATTRACTS BECAUSE AS IRON INSIDE OF IT IT DOESN’T HAVE IRON INSIDE OF
LIKE A NAIL WILL STICK TO A FRIDGE PAPER CLIP AND ALL STUFF THAT HAS IRON IN IT
I THINK
THIS NAIL WILL ATTRACT BECAUSE IT HAS IRON IN IT AND <LAUGH> AND THE RIVER ROCK WON’T ATTRACT WHERE THE BLOCK WON’T ATTRACT BECAUSE IT DOESN’T HAVE IRON IN IT
IT WILL NOT STICK
IT ATTRACT IT ATTRACTS
THE IRON
IT’S IT’S MIDDLE AND INSIDE THE FRIDGE IS METAL TO AND METAL AND METAL OR IRON AND IRON WILL GO TOGETHER AND ATTRACT
IT’S BECAUSE THAT HAS IRON INSIDE OF ITS SO
IT WILL NOT ATTRACT
ABOUT MAGNETISM ATTRACTING AND REPELLING
BECAUSE HAS METAL IN IT LIKE THE IRON
IT’S ATTRACTING TO THE FRIDGE
<SILENCE> GOOD
<BREATHE> BRINGS OUT THAT NOISE GO TOGETHER IT WILL
ITS BECAUSE THEY ARE SAME
THE TWO ONES ONE IS ON A BOTTOM OR ATTRACTING AND THEN THE OTHER THREE ARE REPELLING
IT REPEL
WHEN SOUTH AND NORTH GO TOGETHER IT WILL ATTRACT WHENEVER NORTH AND NORTH IT WILL REPEL SOUTH AND SOUTH WILL REPEL SOUTH AND NORTH WILL ATTRACT
MAGNETISM <SILENCE>
THERE IS
ITS REPELLING
<NO VOICE>
BECAUSE SOMETHING THEY ARE DIFFERENT (*)
GOOD
THE GERMS <SIDE_SPEECH>
ENERGY
SUN IS GIVING THE ENERGY
I DON’T KNOW HOW IS THAT ABSOLUTE
IT KNOWS
BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY
<SIDE_SPEECH>
IT GET SUNLIGHT- IT GIVE HEAT
DO YOU WISH TO
UPWARD
THE CIRCUIT
YOU WILL NOT KNOW
I DON’T KNOW
BECAUSE ONE HAS NON DREAM ONE DOESN’T
IT LIKE- THE CANDLE LIGHT UP
ENERGY WILL NOT WORK
ITS ALWAYS A (*)
BYE
HIGH
ITS GIVING (*)
SHE IS EATING THE FOOD
THE GIRL IS GIVE ENERGY AND HER BODY
<SIDE SPEECH>
+UM+ OH
ITS MELTING
IT WILL GIVE ENERGY
<NO SIGNAL>
ITS GIVING (*)
<SIDE_SPEECH>
HEAT ENERGY <SILENCE>
LIGHTING
BECAUSE GAS WILL GET THE COAL ENERGY <SILENCE><SIDE SPEECH>
I DON’T KNOW
NOPE
HER BODY IS
YOU SEE THE CANDLE SOME
<BREATH>
CANDLE AND IT RELEASED SCIENCE BECAUSE
PERSON
THEY WENT
BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU
BECAUSE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULB RUN OUT OF ENERGY
ITS (*) BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT WILL TURN ON AND IS WHEN IT IS OF THE LIGHT BULB
ITS (*) ITS GOING
THE SERIES CIRCUIT WILL REPLACE THAT BECAUSE <BREATHE> ITS TRAVELLING ENERGY FROM THE PLUS AND THEN WHEN YOU GET INTO THE MINUS WILL GO THROUGH THE PLUS AND BACK TO THE SWITCH AND THEN TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN BACK TO THE MINUS
THE ENERGY WILL START
ONCE LIKE (*) AND THEN THE OTHER IS LIGHTER
THE ENERGY WILL STOP ON THIS
THEY (*)
GOOD
BECAUSE THE ENERGY STARTS
NOTHING HAPPENING
REPEAT THAT
WHEN IT WORKS IT WILL (*) WHEN IT BROKE IT WILL (*)
ITS WHENEVER NORTH NOT ATTRACTING
MAGNETISM
IT WILL BURN OUT BECAUSE IT’S BROKEN
ITS <SILENCE> ITS ONCE SIDE THE PLUS ARE GOING TO AROUND INTO THE SWITCH AND THEN BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN INTO THE MINUS
THIS CIRCUIT +HM+ LIKE CIRCUIT
IT’S THE FIRST ENERGY TO THE SECOND ENERGY TO THE THIRD ENERGY AND WHEN IT BREAKS IT WILL WHEN ALSO THAN WHEN THEY PUT INTO LIGHT BULB IN IT WILL GO BACK
ITS BECAUSE ITS
THERE IT WILL ITS BROKEN
DIM LIGHT
THE ENERGY WILL START
WILL START THAT
ENERGY IS BRING IN IT TO CONNECT
BYE
THEY
THEN YOU HAVE TO SWITCH IT OUT I MEAN WHEN YOU TO AROUND
ITS ENERGY FORCE
BECAUSE ITS ENERGY
IT BREAKS BECAUSE IT BEEN ON TO ONE PROBABLY
IT RUNS OUT
GOOD HOW ARE YOU
WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS ATTRACTING AND REPELLING
WILL RUN OUT
ITS <SILENCE> +UM+ WHEN ITS RAN
IT WILL LIGHT UP
IT'S LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT
THE MINUS
TO HELP YOU SEE <SIDE_SPEECH>
GOOD
THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT
IT GOES UP THE WIRE AND THEN INTO THE LEFT TO MAKE A LIGHT ON THE SIDE AND MAKE GOES DOWN THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE (*)
<NO_SIGNAL>
CARRY THE ELECTRICITY
BECAUSE THEY HAS SOURCE
ITS MOVING TO THE MINUS WAY
IT GOES THE OTHER DIRECTION
IT FLOWS BY <SIDE_SPEECH> IT HAS MUCH ENERGY
<NO_SIGNAL>
TO LET THE LIGHT BULB LIGHT
I THINK <SIDE_SPEECH> IT HELPS THE LIGHT LIGHT UP
IT SWITCHED AROUND
IT'S FLOWING TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN <SIDE SPEECH> AND TO THE
ELECTRICITY
TO <SILENCE> SEE
THAT I REVISED LIKE
IT WILL GIVE A LOT OF ENERGY
<SIDE_SPEECH> IT WILL LIGHT UP THE BULB
ELECTRICITY
THE WIRES
YOU'RE
THE LIGHT
<SIDE SPEECH>
IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP
IT DOEN'T LIGHT UP
BATTERY WIRE AND LIGHT
<SIDE_SPEECH> BATTERY
<SIDE_SPEECH> THEY MAKE THE WIRE
IT IS YOURSELF <SIDE_SPEECH> PROVIDES A (*) BECAUSE SO THE WIRES IF YOU PUT THE WIRES ON THE THE BATTERY IN THE INPUT ON TO THE LIGHT LATER
ENERGY
ITS GIVING A LOT OF ENERGY
STRESS LIGHTING UP A LITTLE
GOOD
ITS BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS THE ENERGY
IT WILL LIGHT UP LIGHTER
THAT WHEN ONE BATTERY WILL ALLOW THE OTHER ONE WE NEED ONE IS OUT AND THE OTHER ONE IS COME BACK IN WILL GIVE LATER AND LATER
TRYING TO MAKE LIGHT BULB LATER
THE D CELL IS GIVING ENERGY TO LIGHT BULB
ITS ENERGY
BECAUSE THE TWO D CELLS ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER
BYE
ITS GIVES ENERGY
<SILENCE> NOW ENERGY
BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS THE ENERGIES TO GO THROUGH THE TWO LIGHT BULBS
THE CIRCUIT IS GIVING A PATH WAY
THREE
<BREATHE> THE DOCS
THE D CELL
ONE D CELL ONE LIGHT BULB HAS ITS (*)
THE D CELL THE LIGHT BULBS THAT MAKES LIGHTER SO (*)
WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO DO A PARALLEL CIRCUIT A MAGNET
THE D CELL STICK TOGETHER
MIGHT NOT HAVE ENERGY
IT WILL GIVE ENERGY THE D CELL GIVES THE ENERGY THROUGH THE WIRES
THE ENERGY WILL GO PASS WILL PASS THROUGH
ITS GIVING ENERGY THROUGH THE D CELL ACTUALLY LIKE ONE OF THEM GO AHEAD NEXT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE ACTIVITY CELL
WE NEED (*) WE NEED AN ANOTHER D CELL IT WILL LIGHT UP LIGHTER
THE D CELL HAD BEEN ELECTRICITY IN THEIR SO BECAUSE THROUGH THE WIRE INTO THE LIGHT BULB THEN THROUGH THE NEXT WIRE IT MAY CONTAIN D CELL
TO GIVE POWER
IT GIVES THE ENERGY
IT WILL STOP
ITS TURNING AROUND
FLAGS
<SILENCE>
THE WIRES HAVE TO TOUCH IT
IT WILL SPIN
TO GIVE POWER SOURCE
IT WILL STOP SPINNING
STARTS
ENERGY
BURNING ENERGY
BYE
<SILENCE>
IT STOPS
GOOD
GIVING ENERGY
ENERGY
GIVING ENERGY
OPEN
POWER
ITS GOING AROUND THE WIRES AND INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE
GIVING POWER
IT GIVE ENERGY
ITS
STOP
SPINNING
TO LIGHT THE FLAG SPIN
IT WILL TURN ON
THE SOLAR SYSTEM
(*)
SPINNING
STARTS TO SPIN
<SILENCE>
THE FLAG IS SPINNING
OPEN
IT WILL NOT SPIN
IT NOT MOVE- (*) ON SPIN
THE MOTORS MOVING
IT WON'T (*) METAL ON TO THAT- IT WANT TO GOES THROUGH
THERE IS NOT ENERGY
THEY WILL NOT TO SPIN- CONNECT TO METAL
THESE ARE CAUSE- THEY ARE- MAKING THEM TO SPIN BECAUSE I HAD METAL
THE SPONGE IS AN INSULATOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT MELT
IT SPINNING
<SIDE_SPEECH>THEY ARE DIFFERENT KIND- SOME ONE METAL AND SOME
SPINNING
THE WIRE IS GOING THROUGH THE- THE WIRE IS GOING THROUGH- INTO THE MOTOR TO MAKE IT SPIN
GOOD
BYE
IS A INSULATOR BECAUSE ITS NON-METAL
IT SPINNING
WHEN YOU PUT THE SPONGE ON IT- IT WILL NOT SPIN
THE WIRE
THESE ARE WIRES- MOTOR
THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THE- THE MOTOR AND ITS MAKING THE MOTOR GOES THROUGH THE- ITS MAKING MOTOR SPIN AND THEN- OTHER ONE IS GOING THROUGH
IT'S METAL SOME ARE THE
IT'S NON-METAL ONE- GIVE THE ENERGY
IF WHAT HAPPEN THAT- THEY WON'T SPIN
BURNING IT WAS
IT'S MADE FROM <BREATH> ELECTRICITY
WHEN YOU DO
IT GIVES IT MORE AIR SO YOU CAN SO YOU CAN SO YOU CAN FLY FASTER
UM GET ONE END OF THE PROPELLER <BREATH> AND SPIN IT AROUND SO IT CAN HAVE MORE AIR
YOU WOULD PUT THEM ON ON THE STRING YOU WOULD TIE IT TO A CHAIR THEN PUT THE AIRPLANE AND SEE HOW MANY WINDS IT WOULD TAKE TO PUT MAKE IF FLY
IF YOU PUT THE STRING UM LIKE THE OTHER ONE THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME CAUSE IT'S THE SAME HEIGHT UM THEY'RE THE THEY'RE LIKE GOING STRAIGHT AND THAT ONE THE ONE ISN'T GOING DOWN
WHAT
SHOW IT ON THE COMPUTER AND LOOKED IT UP ALL LIKE TWENTY FIVE
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE STRING IT COULDN'T FLY CAUSE IT NEEDS STRING TO FLY IT
I THINK IT'S FISH WIRE IT'S FISH LIKE THE LIKE K THE KIND OF STRING YOU USE TO CATCH FISH
T UM HANG ON
THE PLANES ARE P ARE ON THIS ON LI LIKE FISH STRING YOU USE TO UM CATCH FISH AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE LIKE FLYING LIKE REAL AIRPLANES I MEAN PLANES
THE RUBBER BANDS UM SWINGS LIKE TWIRLS AROUND UM THE PROPELLER IS GOING SO IT COULDN'T GET MORE AIR
ONE IS GOING STRAIGHT AND THE OTHER ONE'S KIND OF GOING DOWN
THERE ARE TWO AIRPLANES AND THEY'RE ON STRING
PUT THEM ON THE STRING THEN T THAT WE HAVE TO SEE HOW MANY UM ONCE WE HAVE UM WE HAVE TO TO TO A GET IT TO FLY
HI MARNIE <LAUGH>
MAKE THE RUBBER BAND TIGHTER
I DIDN'T REALLY HEAR YOU THAT TIME
BYE MARNIE
THE STRAWS POPSICLE STICKS UM THAT THING THAT GOES CAN GET SOME AIR AND UH YEAH THAT'S IT
GOOD
MUCH AIR DO YOU USE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF UM STRING LIKE THE WHAT KIND OF STRING THIS IS BUT I BUT IT DEPENDS ON WHICH KINDS OF STRING IT IS CAUSE THEY WOULD STICK YARN STRING IT'S IT'S I THINK IT'S BE HARDER
LIKE THE OTHER ONE EXCEPT THE TOP ONE IS A LITTLE BIT DOWN AND THE OTHER ONE IS KIND OF LIKE HANGING AROUND LIKE NOT THAT HIGH
IT'S GONNA BE HARDER FOR THE THE FOR THE ONE THAT'S GOING DOWN CAUSE IT'S GOING TO NEED WAY MORE AIR THAN THE OTHER ONE
THE ONE'S THAT KIND OF THE ONE THAT'S KIND OF GOING DOWN CAUSE IT'S MORE STRAIGHT UP SO IT WOULDN'T BE THAT MUCH HARD BUT THE ONE THAT'S ON THE BOTTOM IT WOULD BE THAT A BIT MORE HARD BECAUSE IT'S WEIGHT IT'S DOWNER AND YOU NEED A LOT OF AIR TO MAKE IT FLY
WITHOUT THE PROPELLER IT WOULDN'T FLY BECAUSE ANY YOU NEED TO SPIN IT AND THE RUBBER BAND WOULD HAVE NOWHERE TO UM TO
THERE ARE TWO A AIRPLANES AND THEY'RE KIND OF
<COUGH> THE PROPELLER PROPELLER IS UM TO THE TO THE TO THE RUBBER BAND AND THE RUBBER BANDS IS WHAT A MAKE MAKES IT FLY SO UM IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PROPELLER IT WOULDN'T FLY
THESE THINGS THESE THINGS ARE LIKE UH THE FLIPPER THE FLIPPER BASE THE CORK THE RUBBER S THE RUBBER STOPPER THE FLIP STICK AND THE ANGLE BRACE
WE DID A POPSICLE STICK AND UM TWO LITTLE PIECES TO STICK IT ON THERE
HOW HIGH TO
YOU NEED SOMETHING LIKE TO UM LIKE YOU NEED A STICK THEN YOU PUT IT THROUGH THIS LITTLE HOLE AND PUT SOMETHING IT UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED UM BUT THEN YOU PUSH DOWN AND IT LIKE JUMPS UP IT JUMPS UP
BYE
YOU CAN PUT THE THE CORK YOU AND THE RUBBER THE RUBBER STOPPER
WE'RE STILL UM STUDY LEARNING ABOUT CATAPULTS <BREATH>
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED THE UM THE THING YOU PUT THE STICK IN ON AND TO MAKE IT UM JUMP
IF YOU DON'T DO IT THAT UM H THAT LOW I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO JUMP REALLY FAR
I THINK YOU CAN UM PUT IT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF THINGS THEY ARE LIKE IF IT'S SOMETHING REALLY HEAVY I DON'T THINK IT WILL IT'LL JUMP THAT HIGH BUT IF IF IT'S SOMETHING REALLY LIGHT I THINK IT'S GONNA JUMP REALLY FAR
M BYE MARNIE
WHEN YOU WHEN THEY PU WHEN THEY PUSHED THE STICK DOWN UM I THINK I DON'T REMEMBER IF THEY PUT IT REALLY DIDN'T PUT UM ALL THE LIKE WEIGHT ALL THE FINGER WEIGHT ON IT UM IT AND IT JUMPED UM KIND OF HIGH I THINK IT DEPENDS ON HOW HIGH HOW LOW IT GOES CAUSE IF YOU DO IT IT'LL BE
I THINK YOU NEED THE UM THE PROPELLER SYSTEM BECAUSE IF WITHOUT 'EM UM IT WOULDN'T THE CORK WOULDN'T FLY S IT WILL IT WILL KIND OF MAKE IT IT WOULD KIND OF BE LIKE A CHAMPION LIKE WITHOUT THAT THE THING ON THE BOTTOM YOU COULD YOU CAN JUMP
UM YOU NEED I THINK YOU NEED THE
NEED IT BECAUSE YEAH I THINK CAUSE IT HAS UM UM SOME BLACK LINES ON 'EM AND TWO LITTLE STICK THINGS ON 'EM AND BETWEEN I THINK BETWEEN THOSE STICKS YOU PUT A UM CORK AND THAT'S I THINK THAT'S HOW IT JUMPS
I DON'T KNOW THAT YET BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED UM WE JUST STARTED WITH THEM SO BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT
BETTER
YOU PUT THE FLIPPER BASE ON ON LIKE THE LITTLE THINGS THEN IT THEN UM IF YOU PUT IT HIGH I THINK THE UM THE THE FLIP STICK WILL UM WILL GO LIKE THE FLIP STICK WILL GET A BIT HIGHER THEN THE THEN THE CORK WILL UM JUMP ON THE LITTLE UM I THINK MORE HIGHER THAN IF YOU PUT IT LOW
THE STICK IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT THE STICK IT WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO UM UM TO STAND ON AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE TO UM STAND ON AND JUMP OFF
UM YOU REALLY YOU I THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF IT BECAUSE WITHOUT 'EM UM THE CORK WILL HAVE NO WHERE TO S TO SIT ON AND IT WOULDN'T JUMP AT ALL
LIKE TO SEE HOW HIGH YOU SHOULD UM PUT THE CATAPULT IT DEPENDS ON HOW HIGH BECAUSE IF YOU DO IT LOW AND IT WON'T JUMP AS NEAR FAR AS THE HIGH HIGHER ONE
IT GOES IT GOES FLYING IT GOES FLYING FLIP STICK
THE SMALL
I DIDN'T GET THAT QUESTION VERY WELL
SCISSORS UM WATER AND UM THAT'S IT
WE COULD HAVE AND OUT AND THEY COULD JUMP
YOU IT HAS LESS WEIGHT CAUSE UM <BREATH>
FASTER
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS
A LOT OF PENNIES UM THERE'S SOME PENNIES IN THIS PAPER CUP AND FLOATING IN WATER
WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO MAKE BOATS
UM WE COU WE HAVE TO SEE HOW MANY PENNIES IT CAN FIT UNTIL IT DROWNED IT
WE HAD TO SEE HOW MUCH PENNIES IT COULD CA
FIRST WE HAVE TO CUT UM THREE INCHES THEN UM FILL IT UP ALL THE WAY UP AND S UM AND PUT IT IN THESE MESHER THINGIES THEN UM WE HAD TO SEE HOW UM HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD UM GET GET IN THE LIKE PUT IN THE THE BOAT
PEOPLE AND UM PEOPLE
THEY REMIND ME OF LIKE THE PENNIES BEING PASSENGERS
CAUSE UM IT HAS MORE WEIGHT AND WHEN YOU THROW IT UM FROM HIGH IT
HAVE CAN UM CAUSE IT'S SMALLER AND THE UM T THE BIG ONES CARRY MORE CAUSE IT'S CAUSE IT'S TALLER
REALLY BY UP IT IT SINKS FASTER CAUSE UM
PAPER CUPS
TO FLOAT ON WATER AND UM SO PEOPLE COULD GET ON THEM AND SEE THE OCEAN
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM FLOAT OR THEY'LL DR OR THEY'LL OR THEY'LL UM DROWN
THE TALLER ONE CAN CAN CARRY MORE CAUSE IT'S TALLER AND THE SMALLER ONE CAN CARRY C CARRIES LESS CAUSE IT'S SMALLER
I THEY REMIND ME ABOUT HOW MANY PENNIES WE HAVE TO PUT UNTIL IT SINKS
